# Installation

<a href="https://pypi.org/project/anipy-cli/">![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/anipy-cli?style=for-the-badge)</a>

Recommended installation:

`python3 -m pip install anipy-cli --upgrade`

Directly from the repo (may be newer):

`python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/sdaqo/anipy-cli`

For video playback mpv is needed. Get it here: https://mpv.io/installation/

If you would like to use another video player, you will need to specify its path in the config file.

Optionally, you can install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) to download m3u8 playlists instead of using the internal downloader. You can use it with the `-f` flag. This is something you should use if the internal downlaoder fails since ffmpeg is comparatively slow.

### Config

When you start the program for the first time the config file gets created automatically

Places of the config:

- Linux: ~/.config/anipy-cli/config.yaml
- Windows: %USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/anipy-cli/config.yaml
- MacOS: ~/.config/anipy-cli/config.yaml

[Sample Config](https://github.com/sdaqo/anipy-cli/blob/master/docs/sample_config.yaml)

**Attention Windows Users Using MPV:** If you activate the option `reuse_mpv_window`, you will have to download and put the `mpv-2.dll` in your path. To get it go look here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/libmpv/

**Attention Windows Users on Config File Placement:** If you have downloaded Python from the Microsoft Store, your config file will be cached inside of your Python's AppData. For example: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\Local\anipy-cli\config.yaml`.
