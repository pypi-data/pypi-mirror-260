# Overview

Python scripts to analyze the morphology of isolated and interacting galaxies.
The package is designed to download S-PLUS (https://splus.cloud/) and
Legacy (https://www.legacysurvey.org) images automatically. There are functions
to calculate a 2D sky background of the images and deblended segmentation maps of
interacting systems with merger isophotes. The non-parametric analysis is
performed by using `statmorph` package (https://github.com/vrodgom/statmorph).  
The user can study the environment of the object/system by downloading a list of
the galaxies within Field-of-View of S-PLUS/Legacy images from SIMBAD server
(http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/). In addition, there is a function to
display DSS2 (http://alasky.u-strasbg.fr/hips-image-services/hips2fits) images
of any size.
