# fakers
***
This generates pre-built container objects filled with fabricated data.

## What goal this library achieved. 
***
The Faker library primarily offers fake data on an individual basis, so if you need fake data structured in groups of fields, it typically requires additional time and effort. This library saves you that extra time by providing pre-structured fake data groups.

## Usage example
***
Currently, there are two modules available for use: Retail and Person. The Retail module includes entities such as user, product, order, and sale. The Person module provides fake personal and address data.
``` python
from fakers.providers.retail import Retail
import pandas as pd

user = Retail.fake_user()
users = Retail.fake_users(5)

df = users.to_pandas()
```
