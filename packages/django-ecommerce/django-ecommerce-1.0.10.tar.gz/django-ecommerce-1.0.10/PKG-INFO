# Django E-commerce

This Django E-commerce app empowers online retail businesses with robust features for managing products, categories, and
orders. It includes versatile functionalities such as discount management, stock tracking, and flexible settings
configuration to streamline the end-to-end E-commerce process.

## Installation

* Install this package using pip

```bash
pip install django-ecommerce
```

* Add **django_ecommerce** to your **INSTALLED_APPS** setting like this

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    "django_ecommerce",
]
```

## Configuration

In the Django settings file, customize the available currencies for your E-commerce platform by modifying the
`ECOMMERCE_AVAILABLE_CURRENCIES` list. Set the default currency using the `ECOMMERCE_DEFAULT_CURRENCY` variable,
and tailor the displayed fields in the shipping administration interface with the `ECOMMERCE_SHIPPING_ADMIN_FIELDS`.

```python
ECOMMERCE_AVAILABLE_CURRENCIES = [
    ('EUR', 'EUR'),
    ('USD', 'USD'),
]
ECOMMERCE_DEFAULT_CURRENCY = 'EUR'
ECOMMERCE_SHIPPING_ADMIN_FIELDS = ['full_name', 'address', 'phone', 'city', 'shipping_amount', 'remark']
```
