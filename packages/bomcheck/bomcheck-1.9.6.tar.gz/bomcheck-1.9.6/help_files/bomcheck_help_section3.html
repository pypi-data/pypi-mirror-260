    <h3 id="Interim_BOM">1a. The Interim BOM Table defined</h3>

    <p>When bomcheck starts, it gathers all the CAD BOMs, and from those BOMs
     generates a new, single, modified, Interim BOM. The Interim BOM is what
     is used for comparison to SyteLine BOMs. The Interim BOM contains a list
     of assemblies (or subassemblies) and their associated BOMs.  Once an
     assembly is used for analysis, it is removed from the Interim BOM's list
     of assemblies.  Once bomcheck has finished running, if any unused Interim
     BOMs remain, they are presented to the user.</p>

    <p>The Interim BOM has a structure like those in SyteLine; that is, it has
     columns arranged like those in SyteLine, lengths converted to feet, parts
     with the same part nos. combined and with their quantities summed.</p>

    Image #1, Interim BOM
    </p>


    <h3 id="how_to_copy">1b. How to copy from an Interim BOM</h3>
    <p>From the Interim BOM (see image #1), copy, via Ctrl+C, values you want to paste
     from columns Op, WC, Item, and Q.  It is not necessary to copy Description
     and U/M values.  ERP will fill in its own values for these.</p>

    <h3 id="no_inventory">1b i. Make sure to exclude inventory items</h3>
    <p>Do not inventory bin stock items to SyteLine BOMs.  (Unless, possibly,
    you're creating a kit.  Non-inventory items fall under
    SyteLine's product code no. 810.)  These parts include CS pipe nipples, screws,
    etc.  These part numbers can be made to not show in the Interim BOM.  To do this
    employ the "drop list".  (See Section 1 of bomcheck's help.)</p>

    <h3 id="descrips_ignored">1b ii. Descriptions <u>cannot</u> be copied to the clipboard</h3>
    <p>When you copy from an Interim BOM and you inappropriately include values from
    the Description column and/or the U column, bomcheckgui will ignore the
    Description and U values; i.e., they will not be copied to the clipboard.
    (When data is pasted, SyteLine will insert its own Desription and U/M.)</p>

    <h3 id="different_op">1b iii. If OP number is not 10</h3>
    <p>If the Op no. is not 10 for what you will be pasting in, you can
    enter a different Op number into the Interim BOM.  Enter your different number in the
    Op column next to the assembly number.  The remainder of the Op numbers
    for that assembly will automatically change.  Op 15 is shown as an
    example in Image #1.</p>



    <h2 id="pastetoSL">2. How to paste into SyteLine</h2>

    <h3 id="column_order_must_match">2a. Arrange column order must match that of the Interim BOM</h3>
    <p>For a particular item that you wish to create a BOM for, go to
    Item (enter your item no.) > Current Materials.  Then order the columns in
     SyteLine like those shown in Image #2.  I.e., Operation, WC, Material,
    Quantity, Description, and U/M.  (Click <a href="move_columns.html">here</a>
    to learn how to do move columns)</p>

    <p>

    Image #2, SyteLine BOM
    </p>

    <h3 id="use_paste_rows_append">2b. Use Edit > Paste Rows Append</h3>
    <p>After copying from the Interim BOM,
    pick a row where you want your BOM to be pasted, then go to Edit > Paste
    Rows Append.  A popup window opens up looking for data that you want
    pasted.  Do Ctrl+P.  If you are satisfied with what you pasted, click Save.</p>

    <h3 id="manage_warnings">2b i.  Manage popup windows that show warning messages</h3>
    <p>When you're pasting, if an error message pops up saying <u>Slow Inventory
    Item</u>, or <u>Part doesn't exist</u>, etc., click whatever button in the
    popup menu that will allow your paste operation to continue.  You can go
    back later once the pasting is done to make corrections.  If an item doesn't
    exist that you inserted, the pn will be flagged and you will be prevented
    from saving the BOM you just inserted. (Make it easy on yourself.
    Preestablish new subassemblies and new parts before entering items into the main BOM.)</p>

    <h3 id="wrong_op">2b ii.  If you mistakenly paste in the wrong Op number</h3>
    <p>If you mistakenly paste the incorrect Op no., the SyteLine's WC value
    <u>will not</u> be overwritten with <i>PICK</i>.  Instead the WC value will be <u>FAB</u>
    or <u>PAINT</u>, or whatever the WC is for that Op.  You will then know
    that your Op number in incorrect.  Please correct your mistake.</p>

    <p>If the Op no. you try to paste in is not already established
    in SyteLine, the the paste will fail.</p>
