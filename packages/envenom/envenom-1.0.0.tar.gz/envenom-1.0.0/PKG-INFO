---

`envenom` is an elegant application configurator for the more civilized age.

`envenom` is written with simplicity and type safety in mind. It allows
you to express your application configuration declaratively in a dataclass-like
format while providing your application with type information about each entry,
its nullability and default values.

`envenom` is designed with modern usecases in mind, allowing for pulling configuration
from environment variables or files for more sophisticated deployments on platforms
like Kubernetes.
