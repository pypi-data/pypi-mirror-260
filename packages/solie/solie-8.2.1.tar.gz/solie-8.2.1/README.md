**Solie** is a GUI trading bot designed for targeting the futures markets of Binance.

It enables you to create and customize your own trading strategies, simulating them using real historical data from Binance with the power of Python.

Please note that while this solution provides tools for strategy development, profitability is not guaranteed as success depends on individual decision-making.

Solie connects to Binance, retrieves real-time market and account data, saves it on disk, and presents it as intuitive charts to assist users in strategy development.
