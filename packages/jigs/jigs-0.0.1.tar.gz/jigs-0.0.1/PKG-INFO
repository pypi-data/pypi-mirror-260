# Jeffs Image Generating Scripts (jigs)

## Purpose

I found I was writing a number of bespoke scripts for wrapping around
image generation pipelines like Stable Diffusion.

I wanted to toss them into git, so I did.

## Development status

The author (@jepler) occasionally develops and maintains this project, but
does not support it. Issues are not likely to be acted on. Compatibility
over time (e.g., API stability) is a non-goal.
