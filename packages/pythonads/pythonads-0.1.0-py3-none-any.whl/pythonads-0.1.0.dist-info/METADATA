**`PythonAds`** is supporting the Python ecosystem by creating a sustainable, terminal-based ad network, passing 90% of revenues through to developers. 

## How it Works - Developers

PythonAds lets you earn money from your open-source packages by adding a single line of code, which prints a simple text advert. 90% of revenue is passed through to members like you! Here's how to get started:

**(1)** Download the PythonAds package from PyPI:

```shell
pip install pythonads
```

**(2)** Import `pythonads` as the first line in your `__init__.py` or equivalent - the main thing is that the PythonAds message shows at the top when your package is imported or run. 

```python
import pythonads
```

**(3)** Republish your package to PyPI. Now, whenever someone imports or runs your package, an unobtrusive text advert from a PythonAds sponsor will display. 

**(4)** Head to [PythonAds.dev](https://pythonads.dev) to let us know you've joined the network - we'll check everything's working correctly and then send you a link to begin receiving payouts!

## How it Works - Advertisers

Use PythonAds to reach millions of developers around the world, in their terminals. If someone imports or runs a package which is part of the PythonAds network, their terminal will print a custom message like:

`Sponsored by Your Company, the Most Powerful Data Platform` 

To advertise with PythonAds, head to [PythonAds.dev](https://pythonads.dev).
