# [RStockvn](https://pypi.org/project/RStockvn/)
Financial statements of companies on the Vietnamese stock exchange


# Introduce
Hi, my name is Nguyen Phuc Binh.
The reason that I do [RStockvn](https://pypi.org/project/RStockvn/) is to support the collection of basic data for analysis.

The financial statements that RStockvn collects mainly come from websites: [Cafef](https://cafef.vn).

For the exchange rate, RStockvn collects at ["exchangerate.host"](https://exchangerate.host/#/donate) if you have more interest or support for their project you can visit at:[Exchangerate](https://exchangerate.host/#/donate)
### From update 1.0.3 onwards, you can used rstockvn to get macro data.
The figures CPI, FDI, GDP, ... are taken from websites: [Vietstock](https://finance.vietstock.vn/du-lieu-vi-mo)

If you are on the old version and have errors, please update to the new version of RStockvn by: ``pip install --upgrade RStockvn``

Also you can refer to the library:'vnstock', written by Mr. Thinh Vu

# User guide
First you need to install RStockvn by:
``pip install RStockvn`` or ``conda install RStockvn``
To use you need to: ``import RStockvn as rpv`` or ``from RStockvn import *``

## 1. The function gets the list of listed companies

``rpv.list_company()``

Or you want to update list_company

``rpv.update_company()``


## 2. Function to get financial statements from 'vndirect':
`symbol` is the `stock symbol`
`report` is the type of report that needs to get `'BS' or 'BALANCESHEET' or 'CDKT - BalanceSheet`, `'P&L' or 'Business results' - Business results`, ''CF' - Cash Flows'
`year` is the financial year to get
`timely` is the time you want to get by year or quarter

rpv.report_finance_vnd(symbol,report,year,timely)

#### Example
``rpv.report_finance_vnd('vnd','bs','2023','quarter')``

## 3.Function retrieves financial statements of stock tickers from websites: 'Cafef.vn'

``report_finance_cf(symbol,report,year,timely)``
This function is similar to x except with some differences:
'report' will have the following options: `'CDKT' - BalanceSheet`, `'KQKD' - Business results`, `'CFD' - Direct Cash Flows`, `'CF' - Indirect Cash Flows`. `year` corresponds to the reporting datum you want to get. And `timely` corresponds to the choice: `'Year' - year` or `'quy' - quarter.`
#### Example
```
rpv.report_finance_cf('nkg','cfd','2022','year')
```

## 6.View exchange rate change history
At the present time when accessing "exchangerate.host" can only get the history of exchange rates within the last 9 months.``exchange_currency(current,cover_current,from_date,to_date)``
#### Example
```
rpv.exchange_currency('USD','VND','2022-11-23','2023-01-10')
```
You can also convert other currencies, such as Japanese Yen and USD
```
rpv.exchange_currency('JPY','USD','2022-11-23','2023-01-10')
```
## 7.View a quick report on the profit, revenue, ... of a company
For this report I use the financial statements collected from the website 'Cophieu68', because it is similar to the financial statements provided by securities companies such as VNDirect, SSI.``baocaonhanh(mcp,loai,time)``

Here mcp corresponds to the ticker, 'type' corresponds to the following selection:
``'TM' - Thương mại``
For companies that manufacture, retail, basic materials, consumer goods,...
``'TC' - Finance``
For companies in the financial sector.

Because companies in the financial sector are quite separate in nature.
For example, the banking industry is an industry that uses capital to generate cash flow, so RStockvn currently does not provide a quick report template for these industriedsđ

About this kind of report I will add later
#### Example
```
rpv.baocaonhanh('HSG','TM','QUY')
```
