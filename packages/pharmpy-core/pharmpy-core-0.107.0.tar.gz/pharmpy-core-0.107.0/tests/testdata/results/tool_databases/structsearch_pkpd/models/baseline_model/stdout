 WARNINGS AND ERRORS (IF ANY) FOR PROBLEM    1
             
 (WARNING  2) NM-TRAN INFERS THAT THE DATA ARE POPULATION.
             
 (WARNING  23) $PK DOES NOT DEFINE A SCALE PARAMETER FOR THE CENTRAL
 COMPARTMENT.  WITH THIS TRANS, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SEPARATELY
 OBTAIN ESTIMATES OF PARAMETERS AFFECTING CLEARANCE AND VOLUME.
  
Note: Analytical 2nd Derivatives are constructed in FSUBS but are never used.
      You may insert $ABBR DERIV2=NO after the first $PROB to save FSUBS construction and compilation time
