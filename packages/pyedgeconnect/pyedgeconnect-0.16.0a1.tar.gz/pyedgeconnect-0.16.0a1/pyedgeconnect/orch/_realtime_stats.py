    .. note::

        Appliances store per second statistics for only 3 seconds. You
        must poll at a frequency faster than 3 seconds to not have gaps
        in the results when trying to collect continious values.


    * For **Tunnel stats**: Set ``stat_type`` to ``tunnel`` and set
      ``stat_name`` to one of the tunnel names or ``pass-through`` or
      ``pass-through-unshaped``. ``stat_filter`` is not used for tunnel
      statistics.

    * For **TrafficType stats**: Set the ``stat_type`` to
      ``trafficType`` to retrieve two aggregate real-time stats:
      optimized and all-traffic. For optimized, set ``stat_name`` to
      ``0`` and for all-traffic, set ``stat_name`` to ``3``.
      ``stat_filter`` is not used.

    * For **Application stats**: Set ``stat_type`` to ``app``. Set
      ``stat_name`` to application name. ``stat_filter`` is required.
      Accepted values are ``0`` for optimized traffic, ``1`` for
      passthrough shaped, ``2`` for passthrough unshaped, and ``3`` for
      all traffic.

    * For **DSCP stats**: Set ``stat_type`` to ``dscp``, set
      ``stat_name`` to one of DSCP values from ``0`` to ``63``.
      ``stat_filter`` is required. Accepted values are ``0`` for
      optimized traffic, ``1`` for passthrough shaped, ``2`` for
      passthrough unshaped, and ``3`` for all traffic.

    * For **Traffic Class Stats**: set ``stat_type`` to 'trafficClass',
      set ``stat_name`` to one of traffic classes from ``0`` to ``9``.
      ``stat_filter`` is required. Accepted values are ``0`` for
      optimized traffic, ``1`` for passthrough shaped, ``2`` for
      passthrough unshaped, and ``3`` for all traffic.

    * For **Flow stats**: set type to ``flow``, name to ``0`` for TCP
      accelerated, ``1`` for TCP unaccelerated and ``2`` for non-TCP
      flows. ``3`` for all traffic. ``stat_filter`` is required.
      Accepted values are ``0`` for optimized traffic, ``1`` for
      passthrough shaped, ``2`` for passthrough unshaped, and ``3``
      for all traffic.

    * For **Shaper stats**: Set ``stat_type`` to ``shaper``. Set
      ``stat_name`` to one of traffic classes from ``0`` to ``9``.
      ``stat_filter`` to traffic direction, ``0`` for Outbound and ``1``
      for Inbound.

    * For **Drops stats**: Set ``stat_type`` to ``drops``. Set
      ``stat_name`` to empty string

    * For **Interface stats**: set type to ``interface``, and
      ``stat_name`` to interface name. Use ``stat_filter`` to filter
      traffic type, ``0`` for optimized traffic, ``1`` for
      passthrough shaped, ``2`` for passthrough unshaped, and ``3``
      for all traffic.
