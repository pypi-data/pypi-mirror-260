<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Library Objectives

- [ ] Being a lightweight option of RAG, with just the necessary
  dependencies.
- [ ] Focused on RAG with local and open source models, not focused on
  API calls.
- [ ] Try out different strategies and data-structures that can be used
  to have better results. (Such as dataframes, can try out with polars
  as its really performant)
- [ ] Multimodal support, combine image, text and audio to get the best
  results
- [ ] Solve some of the storage challenges RAG faces, and provide good
  solutions for updating documents and embeddings as well as loading
  them.
- [ ] Use it as a educational library to demostrate on some of the main
  concepts llama-index or other RAG framworks use.
- [ ] The base for the implementation of some agentic strategies I will
  try out on other library.
- [ ] Offer support for local models with CPU like llama-cpp
