```
    
## Usage/Examples

```python
from points_table_simulator import PointsTableSimulator
import pandas as pd

# Load the tournament schedule DataFrame
tournament_schedule = pd.read_csv("tournament_schedule.csv")

# Note: 
# The tournament schedule DataFrame should have the following columns:
#   - "match_number" column containing the match number
#   - "home" column containing the home team names
#   - "away" column containing the away team names
#   - "winner" column containing the match result (winning_team_name, draw, or no result)

# If the tournament schedule DataFrame contains different names than this, you can use arguments in PointsTableSimulator class to
# specify the column names. 

# Instantiate the PointsTableSimulator object
simulator = PointsTableSimulator(
    tournament_schedule=tournament_schedule,
    points_for_a_win=3,
    points_for_a_no_result=1,
    points_for_a_draw=1
)

# Calculate the current points table
current_table = simulator.current_points_table()

# Simulate qualification scenarios for a specific team
points_tables, qualification_match_results = simulator.simulate_the_qualification_scenarios(
    team_name="Team A",
    top_x_position_in_the_table=4,
    desired_number_of_scenarios=5
)

# points_tables - will return the list of points_tables (pd.Dataframe) for different qualification scenarios
