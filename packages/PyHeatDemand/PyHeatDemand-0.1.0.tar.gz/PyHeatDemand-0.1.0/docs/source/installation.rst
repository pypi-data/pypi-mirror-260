Installation
============

PyHeatDemand is supported for Python version 3.10 and younger. Previous versions are officially not supported.
It is recommended to create a new virtual environment using the `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ before using PyHeatDemand.
The main dependencies of PyHeatDemand are `GeoPandas <https://geopandas.org/en/stable/>`_ and `Rasterio <https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for the vector data and raster data processing, `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ for plotting,
`GeoPy <https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for extracting coordinates from addresses, `OSMnx <https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for getting `OpenStreet Maps <https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/51.330/10.453>`_ building footprints from coordinates,
`Rasterstats <https://pythonhosted.org/rasterstats/>`_ for analyzing the resulting heat demand maps and more secondary dependencies like `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_, `Shapely <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html>`_, etc.
