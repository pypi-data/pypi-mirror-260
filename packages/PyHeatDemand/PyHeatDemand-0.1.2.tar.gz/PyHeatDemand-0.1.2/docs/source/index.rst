Welcome to documentation page of PyHeatDemand!
==============================================

**PyHeatDemand** is an open-source Python package for processing and harmonizing multi-scale-multi-type heat demand input data for
constructing heat demand maps (raster). Knowledge about the heat demand (MWh/area/year) of a respective building,
district, city, state, country or even on a continental scale is crucial for an adequate heat demand planning or
planning for providing power plant capacities. Mapping of the heat demand may also identify potential areas for new
district heating networks or even geothermal power plants for a climate-friendly heat production.

This documentation contains information about the open-source package PyHeatDemand - Processing Tool for Heat Demand Data.
