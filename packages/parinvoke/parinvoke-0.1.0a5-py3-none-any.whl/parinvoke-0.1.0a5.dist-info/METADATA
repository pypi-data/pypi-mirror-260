# Parallel Processing with Large Shared Models

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/lenskit/parinvoke/graph/badge.svg?token=UWbZZYdp1U)](https://codecov.io/gh/lenskit/parinvoke)

The `parinvoke` library provides parallel processing support for Python with
good support for large (read-only) shared model objects.  Its background and
motivation is described in [this blog post][blog].
