# üß† MindSQL

MindSQL is a Python RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Library designed to streamline the interaction between users and their databases using just a few lines of code. With seamless integration for renowned databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, MindSQL also extends its capabilities to major databases like Snowflake and BigQuery by extending the core class. The library utilizes large language models (LLM) like GPT-4, Llama 2, Google Gemini, and supports knowledge bases like ChromaDB and Faiss.



## üöÄ Installation

To install MindSQL, you can use pip:

```commandline
pip install mindsql
```

MindSQL requires Python 3.10 or higher.

## üí° Usage

# Choose the Vector Store. LLM and DB You Want to Work With
class MindSqlGenAI(VECTOR_STORE, LLM, DATABASE):
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        VECTOR_STORE.__init__(self, config=config)
        LLM.__init__(self, config=config)
        DATABASE.__init__(self, config=config)


# Add Your Configurations
config = {"api_key": "YOUR-API-KEY"}

# Create a MindSQl Object and Connect to Your DB
minds = MindSqlGenAI(config=config)
connection = minds.create_connection("DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL")

# Index Your DB Schemas in mindsql
ddls = minds.get_all_ddls(connection=conn, database="YOUR_DATABASE_NAME")

for ind in ddls.index:
    minds.index_ddl(ddls["DDL"][ind])

# Provide Example Question-SQL Pairs Previously Used by You
minds.index(bulk=True, path="your-qsn-sql-example.json")

# Chat With Your Database!
res = minds.ask_db(question="YOUR_QUESTION", connection=connection)

# Close The Connection to Your DB
