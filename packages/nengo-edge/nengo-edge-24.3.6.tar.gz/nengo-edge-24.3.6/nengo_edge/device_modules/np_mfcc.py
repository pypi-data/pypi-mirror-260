def frame(data: np.ndarray, window_length: int, hop_length: int) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Convert array into a sequence of successive possibly overlapping frames.

    An n-dimensional array of shape (batch_size, num_samples, ...) is converted into an
    (n+1)-D array of shape (batch_size, num_frames, window_length, ...), where each
    frame starts hop_length points after the preceding one.

    This is accomplished using stride_tricks, so the original data is not
    copied.  However, there is no zero-padding, so any incomplete frames at the
    end are not included.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : np.array
        Data to be split into frames, with shape ``(batch_size, num_samples, ...)``.
    window_length : int
        Number of samples in each frame.

    Calculate a "periodic" Hann window.

    The classic Hann window is defined as a raised cosine that starts and
    ends on zero, and where every value appears twice, except the middle
    point for an odd-length window.  Matlab calls this a "symmetric" window
    and np.hanning() returns it.  However, for Fourier analysis, this
    actually represents just over one cycle of a period N-1 cosine, and
    thus is not compactly expressed on a length-N Fourier basis.  Instead,
    it's better to use a raised cosine that ends just before the final
    zero value - i.e. a complete cycle of a period-N cosine.  Matlab
    calls this a "periodic" window. This routine calculates it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window_length : int
        The number of points in the returned window.

    Return a matrix that can post-multiply spectrogram rows to make mel.

    Returns a np.array matrix A that can be used to post-multiply a matrix S of
    spectrogram values (STFT magnitudes) arranged as frames x bins to generate a
    "mel spectrogram" M of frames x num_mel_bins.  M = S A.

    The classic HTK algorithm exploits the complementarity of adjacent mel bands
    to multiply each FFT bin by only one mel weight, then add it, with positive
    and negative signs, to the two adjacent mel bands to which that bin
    contributes.  Here, by expressing this operation as a matrix multiply, we go
    from num_fft multiplies per frame (plus around 2*num_fft adds) to around
    num_fft^2 multiplies and adds.  However, because these are all presumably
    accomplished in a single call to np.dot(), it's not clear which approach is
    faster in Python.  The matrix multiplication has the attraction of being more
    general and flexible, and much easier to read.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_mel_bins : int
        How many bands in the resulting mel spectrum.  This is
        the number of columns in the output matrix.
    num_spectrogram_bins : int
        How many bins there are in the source spectrogram
        data, which is understood to be fft_size/2 + 1, i.e. the spectrogram
        only contains the nonredundant FFT bins.
    audio_sample_rate : int
        Samples per second of the audio at the input to the
        spectrogram. We need this to figure out the actual frequencies for
        each spectrogram bin, which dictates how they are mapped into mel.
    lower_edge_hertz : float
        Lower bound on the frequencies to be included in the mel
        spectrum.  This corresponds to the lower edge of the lowest triangular

    upper_edge_hertz : float
