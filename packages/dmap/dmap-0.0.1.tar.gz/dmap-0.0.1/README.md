# dmap

**dmap** is a framework that helps map dimensional operations. It is currently in its alpha stages (and is not stable), however it is currently capable of emitting C code to perform the forementioned operations.

### Road Map

- Refactor the code structure and remove redundant code.
- Add examples.
- Add documentation.
