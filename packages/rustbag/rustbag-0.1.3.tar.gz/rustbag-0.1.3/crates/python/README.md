RustBag is a yet another ROSBag reader. It's main feature is the ability to read directly from an Object Storage, like AWS S3.
Additionally, it is *fast*, with speeds somewhere in between [rosbags](https://ternaris.gitlab.io/rosbags/) and [embag](https://github.com/embarktrucks/embag).
It is also written in Rust.

## Using RustBag
Please visit [docs website](https://balbok0.github.io/rustbag) for installation, examples and usage orientated documentation.

## Development
You will need at least [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) installed. [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#download) is also highly recommended if you are planning on testing from python side.
