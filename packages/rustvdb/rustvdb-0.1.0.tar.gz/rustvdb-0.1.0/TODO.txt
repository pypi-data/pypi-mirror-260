# Enhanced Clustering-Based Search TODO List

## 1. **Dynamic Cluster Adjustment**

### Steps to Implement:

- **Online Clustering Algorithm Integration:**
  1. Research online (incremental) clustering algorithms suitable for your data type (e.g., StreamKM++, Online K-Means).
  2. Integrate an online clustering algorithm into your existing system, ensuring it can update with batch or real-time data.

- **Cluster Merging/Splitting Mechanism:**
  1. Define clear metrics for when clusters should be merged (e.g., distance between centroids is below a threshold) or split (e.g., a cluster's variance exceeds a certain level).
  2. Implement functions to merge or split clusters based on these metrics, ensuring minimal disruption to the existing cluster structure.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Model Responsiveness:** Regularly inject new data and monitor how quickly the model adapts. Use predefined metrics to evaluate if the clusters remain meaningful post-update.
- **Search Performance Impact:** Before and after applying dynamic adjustments, measure search accuracy and speed. Look for improvements or any unexpected regressions.

## 2. **Enhanced Distance Metrics**

### Steps to Implement:

- **Experiment with Distance Measures:**
  1. Identify and implement at least three alternative distance metrics (e.g., Manhattan, Mahalanobis, Cosine).
  2. Add a configuration option to switch between these metrics in your search queries.

- **Precompute Distance Matrices (if applicable):**
  1. For smaller datasets, implement a caching layer that stores precomputed distance matrices.
  2. Ensure that this caching layer is efficiently integrated into the query processing pipeline to avoid excessive memory usage.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Clustering Quality:** Use internal validation measures (e.g., silhouette score) to assess the quality of clusters formed using different distance metrics.
- **Query Speed Improvement:** For precomputed distances, benchmark the query response times against the baseline to quantify improvements.

## 3. **Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Engineering**

### Steps to Implement:

- **Dimensionality Reduction:**
  1. Experiment with PCA, t-SNE, and autoencoders, assessing their impact on your dataset specifically.
  2. Integrate the chosen dimensionality reduction method into your preprocessing pipeline, ensuring data is consistently transformed before clustering.

- **Feature Selection:**
  1. Use algorithms like Random Forests or mutual information to identify the most important features.
  2. Adjust your data ingestion pipeline to only include these features in the clustering process.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Impact on Clustering:** Evaluate how dimensionality reduction and feature selection affect the compactness and separation of clusters.
- **Search Accuracy and Speed:** Measure any changes in search accuracy and speed, looking for positive impacts from reducing the dimensionality and focusing on key features.

## 4. **Hybrid Clustering Models**

### Steps to Implement:

- **Combine Hierarchical with K-Means:**
  1. First, apply hierarchical clustering to identify broad cluster groups.
  2. Use k-means to refine these groups into more precise clusters.

- **Incorporate Semi-supervised Learning:**
  1. Identify a subset of your data that can be manually labeled or use existing labels.
  2. Integrate a semi-supervised clustering approach that leverages these labels to guide the clustering process.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Enhancement in Clustering Accuracy:** Compare the purity and silhouette scores of clusters before and after applying hybrid models.
- **Relevance of Search Results:** Conduct qualitative assessments or user studies to determine if the search results feel more relevant with the new clustering approach.

## 5. **Query Optimization and Indexing**

### Steps to Implement:

- **Cluster Indexing for Fast Lookup:**
  1. Design a simple indexing scheme that can map query characteristics to potential clusters (e.g., using cluster centroids).
  2. Implement this scheme and integrate it with your query processing, ensuring queries first consult the index to narrow down relevant clusters.



### Refining the Indexing Scheme

1. **Precomputed Similarity Matrix:** For each cluster centroid, precompute its similarity or distance to all other centroids. This matrix can quickly identify neighboring clusters that might also contain relevant results for a query, useful in scenarios where relevant data points might span adjacent clusters.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering Index:** Consider using a hierarchical clustering approach on top of the k-means clusters to create a multi-level index. At the top level, broad categories can be identified, with finer-grained clusters at lower levels. This can speed up the search by quickly eliminating large swathes of irrelevant data.

3. **Feature-Based Indexing:** Beyond centroid similarity, create indices based on prominent features within clusters. For instance, if certain features are highly indicative of cluster membership, create fast lookup tables based on these features to guide the search process even before computing distances to centroids.

### Evaluating and Enhancing Performance

- **Benchmarking Index Access Times:** Measure how quickly your system can identify relevant clusters based on a query. Look for ways to reduce this time, possibly by optimizing data structures or by caching frequently accessed information.

- **Accuracy vs. Speed Trade-offs:** Consider scenarios where a faster but less accurate preliminary search might be beneficial. For example, providing immediate, approximate search results followed by a more thorough search if needed.

- **Dynamic Index Updates:** Ensure your indexing scheme can efficiently handle updates as new data points are added or as clusters change over time. This might involve incremental updates to your indices rather than full recomputations.



- **Implement Query Caching:**
  1. Identify common or costly queries that can benefit from caching.
  2. Implement a caching mechanism that stores and retrieves results for these queries, with appropriate invalidation strategies.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Improvement in Query Processing Time:** Benchmark the average time to return results for a set of standard queries before and after implementing indexing and caching.
- **Cache Efficiency:** Monitor cache hit rates and the impact on query speed to assess the effectiveness of your caching strategy.
