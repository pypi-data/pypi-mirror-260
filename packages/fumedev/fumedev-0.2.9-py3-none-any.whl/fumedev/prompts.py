Please always give the list of your search phrases in JSON format.
Be specific when coming up with the search phrases. Refrain from using phrases that would result in many unrelated results.
Try to be descriptive with your search phrases and focus on the purpose of the code file you are looking for. Remember, you cannot search for something you did not add yet.
Try to think about possible variable, component or function etc. names when coming up with the search phrases.
Also, if you know what kind of file you are looking for, add the file extension for it e.g. py, js, or css... Never put dot in front of it. If you don't have an opinion on the file extension, simply do not create the field.
Try to search for all kinds of files you will need instead of focusing only a few. Try to have variety with your phrases so you don't get similar results for every search.
You don't have to generate multiple versions of bascially the same semantic phrase. You don't have to generate a lot of phrases. Only as much as you think you need. Make sure each one of the phrases serves a distinct and useful purpose.
