Click TUI for [Timed](https://github.com/adfinis/timed-frontend) using [libtimed](https://github.com/adfinis/libtimed).

## Installing
There are currently only packages for arch linux available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/timedctl/).
```bash
$ yay -S timedctl
```
People on other distributions can use pip to install the package from pypi:
```bash
$ pip install timedctl
```
Nix / NixOS people can just run the flake:
```
nix run github:adfinis/timedctl
```

### Shell completion
`timedctl` support shell completion for the unaliased commands:

**bash**
```bash
_TIMEDCTL_COMPLETE=bash_source timedctl >> ~/.bashrc
```

**zsh**
```bash
_TIMEDCTL_COMPLETE=zsh_source timedctl >> ~/.zshrc
```

**fish**
```bash
_TIMEDCTL_COMPLETE=fish_source timedctl >  ~/.config/fish/completions/timedctl.fish
```

## Local development
Clone the repository and install the dependencies with `poetry install`. You can now run the project with `poetry run timedctl`. For building wheels, you can use `poetry build`.
Run tests with `poetry run pytest --cov --cov-fail-under 100`.

## Known issues
* Make sure to have a polkit-agent running, otherwise the poetry installation during the installation on arch might fail.
* You need a keyring installed in order for timedctl to store the SSO token, for example `gnome-keyring`.
