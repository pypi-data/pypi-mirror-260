# VoxRasterLAS
This library rasterises and voxelises 3D point clouds. It takes a laspy object as input and performs feature extraction.

## Overview
This library rasterises and voxelises laspy objects, performing feature extraction at the raster and voxel level, respectively.
To speed up the process, operations are performed using GPUs with the Numba library.

### Voxelisation
Takes a laspy object and return a Voxels object which contains the following properties:
- 

### Rasterisation
Takes a laspy object and return a Raster object which contains the following properties:
-

## Installation
This package can also be used with and without NUMBA package version 0.57. To use with NUMBA, Nvidia drivers and CUDA SDK must be preinstalled (check numba instructions https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/installing.html):

LAS decompressor might be installed via pip compatible with laspy package.

To install VoxRasterLAS (available in pip):
```
python3 -m pip install VoxRasterLAS==0.1.0
```
