## [Unreleased]


## [1.0.5] - 2024-03-06

### Fixed
- Automatic detection of 360° pictures based on make and model also checks for image dimensions (to avoid false positive, when 360° camera can also take flat pictures).
- Slash character in GPS date stamp was not correctly interpreted.


## [1.0.4] - 2024-02-12

### Changed
- When using date/time not coming from GPS, offset time EXIF field are also read (`Exif.Photo.OffsetTimeOriginal` or `Exif.Photo.OffsetTime` depending on used date/time EXIF tag).


## [1.0.3] - 2023-12-18

### Added
- Support reading date from EXIF fields `Exif.Image.DateTime` and `Xmp.GPano.SourceImageCreateTime`.
- Auto-detect if a picture is 360° based on make and model.

### Fixed
- Avoid failures for pictures with invalid offset for maker notes (due to PyExiv2 log level).


## [1.0.2] - 2023-11-20

### Added
- A warning is thrown when microseconds values between decimal seconds and sub-second time fields are not matching.

### Changed
- Fraction values for date, time and GPS coordinates are supported.


## [1.0.1] - 2023-11-17

### Fixed
- `DateTimeOriginal` field wasn't correctly read when seconds value was decimal.


## [1.0.0] - 2023-10-18

### Added
- Add subseconds to written metadata
- Read altitude in metadata
- Write direction and altitude metadata
- Add `additional_exif` tags in `writePictureMetadata`

### Changed
- EXIF list of tags now uses the [Exiv2](https://exiv2.org/metadata.html) notation (example `Exif.Image.Artist`) in returned data. To do this, pyexiv2 dependency is always necessary, and Pillow dependency has been removed. As a consequence, `readPictureMetadata` function __now takes in input `bytes`__ read from picture file instead of Pillow image. This is a breaking change.
- Use overriden metadata is available to localize overriden capture_time


## [0.4.1] - 2023-09-08

### Added
- Latitude and longitude values are checked to verify they fit into WGS84 projection bounds (-180, -90, 180, 90).


## [0.4.0] - 2023-09-01

### Added
- When a picture does not contain a mandatory exif tag (coordinates or datetime), a `PartialExifException` is thrown containing some information about what has been parsed and what is missing.

## [0.3.1] - 2023-07-31

### Added
- A way to write exif lon/lat and type tags.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-07-31

### Added
- Support of any date/time separator for EXIF tag `DateTimeOriginal`
- A way to write exif tags. To use this, you need to install this library with the extra `[write-exif]`.


## [0.2.0] - 2023-07-13

### Added
- Support of cropped equirectangular panoramas

### Changed
- Support python 3.8

## [0.1.3]

### Changed
- Bump [Typer](typer.tiangolo.com/) version, and use fork of [Typer-cli](https://gitlab.com/geovisio/infra/typer-cli)

## [0.1.2]

### Added
- Full typing support ([PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) and [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/))


## [0.1.1]

### Added
- Support of Mapillary tags stored in EXIF tag `ImageDescription`


## [0.1.0]

### Added
- If GPS Date or time can't be read, fallbacks to Original Date EXIF tag associated with a reader warning
- New EXIF tags are supported: `GPSDateTime`

### Changed
- `tag_reader:warning` property has been moved from EXIF, and is now available as a direct property named `tagreader_warnings` of `GeoPicTags` class
- Reader now supports `GPSLatitude` and `GPSLongitude` stored as decimal values instead of tuple
- Reader now supports reading `FocalLength` written in `NUMBER/NUMBER` format
- If EXIF tags for heading `PoseHeadingDegrees` and `GPSImgDirection` have contradicting values, we use by default `GPSImgDirection` value and issue a warning, instead of raising an error

### Fixed
- EXIF tag `SubsecTimeOriginal` was not correctly read due to a typo


## [0.0.2] - 2023-05-10

### Added
- EXIF tag `UserComment` is now read and available in raw `exif` tags
- If not set, `GPSLatitudeRef` defaults to North and `GPSLongitudeRef` defaults to East
- A new `tag_reader:warning` property lists non-blocking warnings raised while reading EXIF tags


## [0.0.1] - 2023-03-31

### Added
- EXIF tag reading methods extracted from [GeoVisio API](https://gitlab.com/geovisio/api)
