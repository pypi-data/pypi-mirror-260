`pt` stands for either one of "personal tool", "plex tool", "pete" or something among those lines.
It is a collection of tools that i might or might not use. The intended purpose of this repo is that
I program whatever i feel is worth having in a personal thing into it, then use it as either a lib,
crate, python module or executable.

Let's see if I make it a bloated mess or stop committing after 30 hello worlds.
