# Frequenz Client Base Library Release Notes

## Summary

* The generated docs now show the type of symbol in the table of contents and have cross-linking to the protobuf and channels documentation.
* The minimum supported version of `protobuf` was downgraded to 4.21.6, so downstream projects having this older version as minimum requirements can still use this release.
