**LocalCat** is designed to make the LLM strategy easy to implement. It provides a simple API and an intuitive interface for loading, fine-tuning, and deploying large deep learning models. With LocalCat, you can easily fine-tune pre-trained models on your own data and leverage their power for your specific tasks.

## Tasks
### Translation
LocalCat offers user-friendly tools for translation tasks, allowing the translator to be deployed as an endpoint or for batch processing of `pandas` dataframes. Additionally, it provides fine-tuning capabilities for cloud deployment. 

1. Load pre-trained LLMs locally or from HuggingFace
2. Fine-tune the LLMs
3. Deployment as an endpoint on AWS

### Chat
(On the way. Stay tuned.)

## Install
```python
pip install localcat
```

## The Story behind LocalCat

LocalCat is named after a cat named Hulu (葫芦), owned by my friend Flora. The inspiration for the name came from the cat's playful and curious nature, which aligns with the goals of the LocalCat package.
