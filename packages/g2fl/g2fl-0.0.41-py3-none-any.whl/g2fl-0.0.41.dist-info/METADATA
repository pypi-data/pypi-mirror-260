## Endorsements

> <p>"In less than a decade, the AI revolution has swept from research labs to broad industries to every corner of our daily life.  Dive into Deep Learning is an excellent text on deep learning and deserves attention from anyone who wants to learn why deep learning has ignited the AI revolution: the most powerful technology force of our time."</p>
> <b>&mdash; Jensen Huang, Founder and CEO, NVIDIA</b>

> <p>"This is a timely, fascinating book, providing with not only a comprehensive overview of deep learning principles but also detailed algorithms with hands-on programming code, and moreover, a state-of-the-art introduction to deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing. Dive into this book if you want to dive into deep learning!"</p>
> <b>&mdash; Jiawei Han, Michael Aiken Chair Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</b>

> <p>"This is a highly welcome addition to the machine learning literature, with a focus on hands-on experience implemented via the integration of Jupyter notebooks. Students of deep learning should find this invaluable to become proficient in this field."</p>
> <b>&mdash; Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf, Director, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</b>

> <p>"Dive into Deep Learning strikes an excellent balance between hands-on learning and in-depth explanation. I've used it in my deep learning course and recommend it to anyone who wants to develop a thorough and practical understanding of deep learning."</p>
> <b>&mdash; Colin Raffel, Assistant Professor, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</b>
