           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Detailed Tutorial to run the LeafcutterITI

In this tutorial, we walk through all the steps to run the LeafcutterITI pipeline. For each step, we discuss the possible parameters that can be changed, how to do so and the considerations involved in each of the parameters. Finally, we show example inputs and outputs of each step (with column explanations) so the user knows what to expect and can make custom files as needed.


### Step 0: Transcriptome annotation download or generation and Salmon isoform quantification

Example human transcriptome annotation can be downloaded from https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/


### Step 1: Isoform to intron map generation

In this step, LeafcutterITI_map_gen will be used to generate a map that contains information about which isoform is generated by splicing which introns. The map will also contain information about which exon is in which isoform. This step only needs to run once for each unique transcriptome annotation gtf file. 

Sample run:
```
python LeafcutterITI_map_gen -a gencode.v45.annotation.gtf --annot_source gencode -o sample_run_ --maxintronlen 5000000 --minintronlen 50 -v False          
```


Depending on the setting, two or four files will be generated.
- {out_prefix}isoform_intron_map.tsv
- {out_prefix}intron_exon_connectivity.tsv
- {out_prefix}isoform_intron_map_with_virtual.tsv
- {out_prefix}intron_exon_connectivity_with_virtual.tsv

where with_virtual mean virtual intron was used to capture AFE and ALE (testing feature). Both transcript_intron_map.tsv and intron_exon_connectivity.tsv

if annotation_source='gencode', an additional file will be generated to give out information about the possible isoform type that can be generated by splicing out each intron
- {out_prefix}intron_source_map.tsv

This is a testing feature that haven't been tested yet
  
A record file that contain the parameters will also be generated

### Step 2: Salmon isoform quantification

For usage of Salmon please refer https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html

In the rest of the tutorial, we assume RNA-seq data were aligned to the transcriptome using Salmon. Then we will obtain file ending with .sf that described the isoform quantification results.


### Step 3: LeafcutterITI clustering

For this step, we will need the file generated from step 1, the file path and the name for the isoform quantification files generated by Salmon, and the transcriptome annotation


Sample run:
```
python LeafcutterITI_clustering --map transcript_intron_map.tsv --count_files quantification_files.txt --connect_file intron_exon_connectivity.tsv -a gencode.v45.annotation.gtf --cluster_def 3 \
                                --normalization True -o sample_run_ --minclucounts 30 --mincluratio 0.01
```


Two main output files will be obtained:
- {out_prefix}refined_cluster
- {output_prefix}ratio_count

sample {out_prefix}refined_cluster
```
sample1.sf sample2.sf sample3.sf sample4.sf sample5.sf sample6.sf
chr1:17055:17233:clu_1 21.1 13 18 20 17 12 
chr1:17055:17606:clu_1 4 11.4 12 7 2 0 5 
chr1:17368:17606:clu_1 127 132 128 55 93 90 68 
chr1:668593:668687:clu_2 3 11.3 1 3 4 4 8 
chr1:668593:672093:clu_2 11 16 23 2.5 3 20 9
```

These two files are equivalent to Leafcutter clustering numers.counts.gz and counts.gz. It is worth noticing that the normalized count or TPM is not necessarily an integer, but the normalized count will exhibit a count-like property.




### Step 4:
The output from step 3 is equivalent to results from leafcutter clustering, and the results are compatible with downstream analysis for Leafcutter, such as Leafcutter_ds and Leafviz.
