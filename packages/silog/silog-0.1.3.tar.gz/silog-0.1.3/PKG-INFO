# silog

silog is a simple logging library for Python. Designed to no worries about the underlying log file management.

## Features

- Automatic rotation of log files based on the date, ensuring that log files are organized by day.

```bash
pip install silog
```

To use silog in your project, import the 'Silog' class and initialize it with your desired log directory.
