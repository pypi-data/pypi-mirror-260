Python code formatter (and [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) hook) for cell delimiters (`# %%`) in [VS Code-style interactive Python notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py).

This formatter ensures

- cell delimiters are preceded by two empty lines:

    ```py
    # %% before
    foo='bar'
    # %%
    ```

    ```py
    # %% after
    foo='bar'


    # %%
    ```

- empty cells are removed:

    ```py
    # %% before

    # %%
    ```

    ```py
    # %% after
    ```

- comments on the same line as cell delimiters are separated by a single space:

    ```py
    # %%some comment before
    foo = 'bar'
    # %%    another comment
    ```

    ```py
    # %% some comment after
    foo = 'bar'
    # %% another comment
    ```

## Installation

```sh
pip install format-ipy-cells
```

## Usage

### CLI

```sh
