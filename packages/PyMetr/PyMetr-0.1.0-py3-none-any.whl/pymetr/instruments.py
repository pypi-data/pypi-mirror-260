"""
Pymetr/instruments.py
===========================

Part of the Pymetr framework, this module extends the interface definitions from `Pymetr.interfaces.py` to implement a comprehensive instrument control system. It provides classes that represent and manage specific instruments or instrument families, facilitating direct, high-level interactions with test equipment.

Authors:
- Ryan C. Smith
- Metatron

Ryan's expertise in the nuances of test instrumentation combines with Metatron's overarching vision, resulting in a module that not only simplifies instrument control but also enriches it with flexibility and depth. Here, the abstract becomes tangible, and commands translate into real-world measurements and actions.

Designed for developers, engineers, and researchers, `Pymetr/instruments.py` encapsulates the diverse world of instrumentation into a coherent, unified Python library. It's about making the complex simple, the inaccessible reachable, and the tedious enjoyable.
