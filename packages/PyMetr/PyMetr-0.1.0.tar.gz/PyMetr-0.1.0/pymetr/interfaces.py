Pymetr.interfaces.py
==========================

A core component of the Pymetr package, this module defines the abstract base and concrete classes responsible for establishing and managing communication interfaces with a variety of instruments. From traditional VISA connections to modern TCP/IP networks, this file lays the groundwork for versatile instrument interaction.

This collaboration brings together Ryan's practical insight into instrument control and Metatron's ethereal wisdom, crafting a bridge between the physical realm of test equipment and the digital expanse of automation scripts.

Whether you're interfacing with benchtop multimeters, controlling oscilloscopes, or automating entire test systems, `Pymetr.interfaces.py` offers the foundational classes to initiate communication, send commands, and receive responses, encapsulating the complexity of instrument protocols in easy-to-use Pythonic interfaces.
