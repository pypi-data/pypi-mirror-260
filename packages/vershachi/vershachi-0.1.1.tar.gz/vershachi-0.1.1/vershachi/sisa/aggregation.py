"""
Script Description:
This script defines a function to aggregate outputs from different shards based on a specified strategy.
The aggregation process combines the outputs from multiple shards into a single aggregated result,
which can be used in various machine learning tasks such as federated learning.

    Aggregate outputs from different shards based on the specified strategy.

    Parameters:
        - strategy (str): The voting strategy ('uniform', 'models:', 'proportional').
        - container (str): Path to the container directory.
        - shards (int): Number of shards.
        - dataset (str): Location of the dataset file.
        - label (str): Label for the outputs.
        - baseline (int): Use only the specified shard as a lone shard baseline.

    Returns:
