# PrimeNote
PrimeNote is an intuitive sticky note-taking application for Linux and Windows. It allows the user to effectively edit, store and organize an infinite number of notes. PrimeNote supports various operation modes, such as `plain text`, `rich text`, `image`, `vim` or `console` (terminal emulator). It is well structured and fully featured, including;

- **Always on top** notes, without cluttering the taksbar
- **Druide Antidote** grammar tools built-in support (versions 9, 10 and 11)
- **Smart formatting**, using enhanced 'plain' text where the input is standardized, yet allows basic text decorations
- **Cross-platform compatibility**, with official support for Linux and Windows 7-10
- **Neat organization**, with all data stored by folder structure using human-friendly formats
- **Fernet encryption**, to protect sensitive data
- **Quick search** built-in keyboard-driven tool to browse among note titles and content
- **Special paste** feature to quickly copy text from PDF documents
- **Images support**, with basic viewing features
- **Fully customizable** appearance, menus, hotkeys and mouse events
- **Virtual machine support**, edit a shared note repository in real time
- **Command-line interface** access to all notes (see `pnote -h`)

Its open source software is licensed under GPLv3.

# Advanced Features
## Customizable window styles and palettes
- All notes are decorated using CSS files located at the program root;
  - `ui/global.css`: defines the overall geometry and style for all notes
  - `ui/styles/*`: overrides and extend `global.css` attributes
  - `ui/palettes/*`: handles widgets and icons color schemes
- Users can extend those with custom palettes and styles, override or ignore them
- PrimeNote adds its own CSS selector `NoteDecorations` for enhanced customization

## Console mode
- In this mode, the text box is replaced with a native terminal emulator
- When a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) is found, the file content is automatically executed in the terminal
- More QTermWidget color schemes can be added into `ui/terminal`
- For more details, see [QTermWidget GitHub Project page](https://github.com/lxqt/qtermwidget)

## Vim mode
- Provides a fully featured Vim instance in every note
- System-independent `vimrc` file and theme files
- Two-way communication between Vim servers and PrimeNote command-line interface
- Default settings allow for a seamless design between the text editing modes

## Virtual machine support
PrimeNote can be used simultaneously across two operating systems (OS). Thus, one can share a note folder with another user, a backup server or a virtual machine.<br/>

PrimeNote fully supports symbolic links (symlinks) on Linux, and partially on Windows. Hence, all notes can be stored in a remote location simply by replacing the notes repository folder with a symlink. Likewise, a symlink can be added into the repository. On Windows, however, please note that shortcuts do not equal symlinks, which require administrator privileges. Thankfully, PrimeNote provide a utility to ease the addition of symlinks into the note repository.

**Virtual machine**
- Create a symlink to the host notes repository
- Place it into a folder shared with the client machine
- On the client side, open a PrimeNote instance and right click on the tray icon
- Select `Open in a file manager`
- Replace the opened folder by the symlink, or add the symlink into it

**Limitations**
- `Rename` and `move` operations on symlinks will behave unexpectedly if used across two OS
- Nested symlinks are not yet supported on Windows
