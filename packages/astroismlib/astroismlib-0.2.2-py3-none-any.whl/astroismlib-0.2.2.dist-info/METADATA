# astroismlib

This package is a collection of routines to plot grids of shock
and ionization models in BPT diagrams. There are also routines
to correct by dust extinction given the observed Balmer lines (e.g., Halpha and Hbeta) and different extinction laws. In addition, there are functions to compute HII regions properties such as electronic density, mass, number of ionization photons, Stromgren Radius, etc.
