Reference: [Resolution for PATH not being set when using pip install in Python on Windows | Yusu Note](https://yusu79.com/python-path-issue/)


## Quick Usage
```bash
$ marktree [Options] [foo.md]
```


| Options            | Description                                                                                        | 
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| marktree -h        | Display the help screen.                                                                           | 
| marktree --help_jp | Display the help screen in Japanese.                                                               | 
| marktree -L 3      | The -L option determines the level at which the tree is displayed.                                 | 
| marktree -C        | The -C option outputs the Markdown text copied to the clipboard directly in tree format. | 

### Example
Prepare the following Markdown named `foo.md`.
```md
# h1 
## h2 
### h3 
#### h4 
#### h4 
## h2 
## h2
### h3 
#### h4 
##### h5 
###### h6 
### h3
# h1 
```

- Regular output (default depth is 6):
```bash
$ marktree foo.md
├── h1 
│  ├── h2 
│  │  └── h3 
│  │     ├── h4 
│  │     └── h4 
│  ├── h2 
│  └── h2
│     ├── h3 
│     │  └── h4 
│     │     └── h5 
│     │        └── h6 
│     └── h3
└── h1 
```

- Use `-L 3` to determine the depth:
```bash
$ marktree -L 3 foo.md
├── h1 
│  ├── h2 
│  │  └── h3 
│  ├── h2 
│  └── h2
│     ├── h3 
│     └── h3
└── h1 
```
- Use `-C` outputs the Markdown text copied to the clipboard directly in tree format. Additionally, `-L` can be used in combination:
```bash
$ marktree -C -L 3
├── h1 
│  ├── h2 
│  │  └── h3 
│  ├── h2 
│  └── h2
│     ├── h3 
│     └── h3
└── h1 
```


## Usage

The `marktree` command outputs the file as a tree hierarchy, depending on the `#` of the Markdown file. 
The `-L` option specifies the depth, as in the original `tree` command. Note that the depth can be from 1 to 6, and specifying more than that will result in an error.
The `-C` option outputs the Markdown text structure copied to the clipboard directly in tree format. This is convenient as it eliminates the need to copy the Markdown text to another file before outputting.

The order of the options is in no particular order, including the Markdown file to be passed. Also, if you pass multiple files like `markdown foo.md hoge.md`, **only the last file** will be converted and output.
