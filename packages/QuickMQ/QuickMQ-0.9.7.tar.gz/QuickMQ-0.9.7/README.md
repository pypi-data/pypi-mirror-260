## Description

QuickMQ is a purely python implementation of a RabbitMQ client. QuickMQ abstracts quite a few RabbitMQ concepts like channels, publisher confirms, and message encoding to make interacting with RabbitMQ as easy as possible.  

These abstractions make the package a good fit for anyone looking to quickly and easily interact with RabbitMQ servers.

### What QuickMQ ***Cannot*** Do

* Work queues
* Transactions
* Consumer confirmations

QuickMQ is simple on purpose, so if you require the above features or the abstractions don't work well for you, clients like [pika](https://github.com/pika/pika) or [aio-pika](https://github.com/mosquito/aio-pika) might be a better fit.

## Installation

QuickMQ is currently still being tested, but it can be installed from the PyPI index.

```bash
pip install quickmq
```

To install the most recent version from GitLab.

```bash
pip install git+https://gitlab.ssec.wisc.edu/mdrexler/quickmq.git
```

### Requirements

Python >= 3.6

## Features

QuickMQ comes with some useful features, all which are easy to use.

### Multi-Server Actions

With QuickMQ you're able to connect to and publish/listen for messages from multiple servers at the same time.

```python3
import quickmq.api as mq

mq.connect('server1', 'server2', auth=('user', 'pass'))

mq.publish('Hello World!') # publishes to both servers
```

### Automatic Reconnection

Server connections can reconnect automatically in case of sporatic drops.

```python3
import quickmq.api as mq

# Connections will try to reconnect 3 times,
# waiting a minute between each attempt
my_cfg = mq.configure(RECONNECT_DELAY=60, RECONNECT_TRIES=3)

mq.connect('destination', cfg=my_cfg)
```

### Queue Messages While Reconnecting

It's possible to queue messages while a connection is reconnecting and publish them when the server connections again. The default behavior is to drop all messages when the connection is reconnecting.

```python3
import quickmq.api as mq

my_cfg = mq.configure(DROP_WHILE_RECONENCT=False)

mq.connect('destination', cfg=my_cfg)
```

### Command Line Interface

QuickMQ also installs with a CLI for use outside of python scripts.

```bash
quickmq publish -e exchange -s server(s) -u username -p password
```

Use `quickmq --help` for more information.
