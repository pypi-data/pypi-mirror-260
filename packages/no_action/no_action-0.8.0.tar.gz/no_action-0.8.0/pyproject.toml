# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can
# either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where
# it should appear only once). You can also use "--disable=all" to disable
# everything first and then re-enable specific checks. For example, if you want
# to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use "--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W".
