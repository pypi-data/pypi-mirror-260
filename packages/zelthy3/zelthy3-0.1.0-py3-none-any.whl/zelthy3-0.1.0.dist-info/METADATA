#### Drastically reduce your per app cost through Zelthyâ€™s multi-tenant approach:

Zelthy redefines multi-tenancy by enabling multiple different apps to run on a single server. Say goodbye to the limitations of traditional scaling methods. With our platform, you can run multiple different applications on a single server, which helps in keeping the cost in check.
