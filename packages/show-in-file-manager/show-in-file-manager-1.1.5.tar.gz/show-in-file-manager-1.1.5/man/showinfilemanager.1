.SH NAME

showinfilemanager - open the file manager and select files in it
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]showinfilemanager\f[R] [\f[B]-h\f[R]] [\f[B]\[en]version\f[R]]
[\f[B]\[en]verbose\f[R]] [\f[B]\[en]debug\f[R]] [\f[B]URIs \&...\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]showinfilemanager\f[R] opens the system file manager and optionally
selects files in it.
The point is not to \f[I]open\f[R] the files, but to \f[I]select\f[R]
them in the file manager, thereby highlighting the files and allowing
the user to quickly do something with them.
.PP
For file managers that do not support specifying files to select, this
program will instruct them to display the directory the file is found
in.
.TP
\f[B]URIs\f[R]
URIs or paths of files or directories.
.TP
\f[B]-h\f[R], \f[B]\[en]help\f[R]
Display help message.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]version\f[R]
Show program\[cq]s version number and exit.
.TP
\f[B]-f\f[R], \f[B]\[en]file-manager\f[R] \f[B]FILE_MANAGER\f[R]
File manager to run
.TP
\f[B]-s\f[R], \f[B]\[en]select-folder\f[R]
Select folder instead of displaying its contents.
By default, when a URI or path is a directory and not a file, the
directory itself is shown in the file manager.
This option changes the default and selects the folder, displaying it in
its parent directory.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]verbose\f[R]
Display command being run to stdout.
.TP
