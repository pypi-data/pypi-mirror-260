# Examples
This is an example of what the utility can do. After populating the `inputs` directory with roles of my own creation,
the remaining directories were created using the following commands:

```bash
botc_tokens create example/inputs example/tokens --component-dir example/components
botc_tokens group example/example_script.json --token-dir example/tokens --output-dir example/printables
```

Yes, these roles are stupid. No, I wouldn't advise using them in a game. Still, they demonstrate what you can expect
when using the utility with your own roles.
