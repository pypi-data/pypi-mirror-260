# cropmerge
Library for cropping point clouds in blocks and merge them with semantic and instance labels.

## Overview
Points in hte overlap area are repeated betweeen blocks.
For merging semantic labels it is used the probability of each class as input. The output probability of a point is the mean of the probabilities of that points in each block.
For merging instance labels the are not merged point by point, bt instance by instance. Instance j of block J and instance i of block I are merge if and only if the maximum IoU of instane j with all the instances of block I is with the instance i, and vice versa.
