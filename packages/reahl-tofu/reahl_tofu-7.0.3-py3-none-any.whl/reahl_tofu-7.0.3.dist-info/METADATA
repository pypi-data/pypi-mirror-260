 Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in 
 terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.

 Tofu is part of the Reahl development tools.
 Tofu can be used independently of the Reahl web framework.

 Tofu allows you to have
 a hierarchy of test fixtures that is *completely* decoupled from your
 hierarchy of tests or test suites. Tofu includes a number of other
 related test utilities. It also includes a plugin for nosetests
 that makes using it with nose seamless.

 Tofu can also be used to run the set_ups of fixtures from the command 
 line.  This is useful for acceptance tests whose fixtures create data
 in databases that can be used for demonstration and user testing.
