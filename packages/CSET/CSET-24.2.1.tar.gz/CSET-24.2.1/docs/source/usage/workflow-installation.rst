Install and run the CSET workflow
=================================

CSET is typically run through a `cylc workflow`_. The first thing you will need
to do is download the CSET workflow. The easiest way to do that is via the
`Releases`_ page on GitHub, or you can clone the repository. Once downloaded the
tarball or zip can be unpacked to a location of your choosing.

CSET uses **cylc 8**, so you must ensure that is the version of cylc configured
for usage. For the Met Office installation this involves setting an environment
variable before running cylc with the following commands:

.. code-block::bash

   export CYLC_VERSION=8
   cylc --version  # Check version starts in 8

You will then need to edit the configuration to set up your job. Start by making
a copy of the ``rose-suite.conf.example`` file called ``rose-suite.conf``. This
needs further amendments, which are done using `rose edit`_, a GUI configuration
tool. Within rose edit go through the sections under "suite conf" and fill in
the config. Help can be viewed by clicking on the name of a variable. Once you
have configured CSET, you can save and close rose edit.

Opening a command line inside the root of the CSET folder, you navigate to the
``cset-workflow`` directory and then you can run it with the command ``cylc vip
.``, which will cause cylc to submit the job to your site's batch processing
system, and run it. You can view the job's progress with the cylc gui,
accessible with the command ``cylc gui``.

Once CSET has finished running you will receive an email containing a link to
the output page.
