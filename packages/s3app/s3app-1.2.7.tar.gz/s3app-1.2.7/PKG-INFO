           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Installation
We provide two installation methods. A native installation on any OS which supports Python3 and a installation in Kubernetes via HELM.
Per default, S3App runs on a sqlite database. Sqlite is recommended only for testing and on a standalone installation.

In production, you should use a PostgreSQL database for a better data persistency and to allow a HA setup with more S3App nodes.

The S3App has no TLS-termination ("https"). We recommend to use a Reverse Proxy like NGINX or Apache Web Server in front of S3App Web App for TLS termination.

The HELM project of S3App for Kubernetes contains all needed and recommended components. You can optionally install a NGINX Reverse Proxy and a PostgreSQL database with the project,
but you can also use separated applications.

### Native
#### Prerequisites
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Python-pip](https://pip.pypa.io) for dependency installation
- OpenLDAP for LDAP authentication
- SSL for secured LDAP authentication
- recommended: python3-venv to create a virtual environment for Python3
- recommended: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database for the S3App metadata
- recommended: A reverse proxy with TLS termination (e.g. NGINX).

#### Prerequisites Python and pip
S3App supports all current Python3 versions. It is tested with Python 3.9.x and 3.10.x

To check which Python version is running:
```
vagrant@bullseye:~$ python3 -V
Python 3.9.2
``` 
To check which Pip version is running:
``` 
vagrant@bullseye:~$ pip3 -V
pip 20.3.4 from /home/vagrant/s3app/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip (python 3.9)
``` 

It is possible, that in your distribution Python must be called with `python` and `pip`.

If you need a Python installation from the scratch. Python3, Pip3 and python3-venv are available in the main OS distribution.

For Debian/Ubuntu:
`sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-venv`

For RedHat/CentOS:
`sudo yum install python3 python3-pip python3-venv`

#### Prerequisites OpenLDAP and SSL
For authentication packages for authentication like OpenLDAP and SSL are needed  
For Debian/Ubuntu:
`sudo apt-get install libsasl2-dev python-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev`

For RedHat/CentOS:
`sudo yum install python-devel openldap-devel`

#### Installation
There are a lot of variants how to start a Python web project. We use a Python virtual environment for setting up S3App on a virtual environment. 
Depend on your environment and knowledge in Python the process can be different.

1. Create a virtual environment of Python
 
   1. Create a virtual environment for S3App
   
      ```
      vagrant@bullseye:~$ python3 -m venv venv
      ```

   2. Activate your virtual environment

      This steps is to repeat every time you want to restart S3App.
   
      ```
      vagrant@bullseye:~$ source venv/bin/activate
      (venv) vagrant@bullseye:~$
      ```

3. Install all Python dependencies needed for the project:

   ```   
   (s3app) vagrant@bullseye:~$ pip install s3app --upgrade
   ```

4. Start S3App server
   ```   
   (s3app) vagrant@bullseye:~$ s3app-run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080

4. Open Browser and start S3App with one of the IPs mentioned above:

   ![Login Site of S3App](https://www.yotron.de/s3app/login.png)

   Your will automatically redirected to http://x.x.x.x:8080/login

5. Login as a admin user
   
   The default credentials for the admin user are:
 
   **Username**: admin

   **Password**: admin

   ![Dashboard of S3App](https://www.yotron.de/s3app/dashboard_item_empty.png)

   Please see the [manual](https://www.yotron.de/s3app/) to allow access to buckets.


### HELM
You find the installation instructions for Kubernetes [here](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/yotron-helm-charts/s3app)

## Manual
The manual for S3App you find [here](https://www.yotron.de/s3app/)

## Configuration
### The dotenv file and `S3APP_CONF_FILE` variable
You can customize S3App with a setting defined in a dotenv file. The dotenv file can be chosen freely and you can put the file in a folder of your choice but 
the file must be reachable by the S3App App. 

Additionally, you need a environment variable `S3APP_CONF_FILE` with the path to your config file.

For example, for Linux you can set the environment variable with:
```
export S3APP_CONF_FILE=/etc/s3app/.s3app
```
with `.s3app` as the dotenv file name.

The file contains setting to the following topics:
- customization of your S3App
- Authentication

### The parameter of the config file

    "cn=s3appadmins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": ["Admin"],
}
```

#### Authentication LDAP
To allow authentication with LDAP, a LDAP group must be mapped onto one the S3App Role `S3Manager`, `S3User` or `Admin` . After the first authentication a new user, the user must be added to the `S3Access`
or `S3Group`. Please see the [manual of S3App](https://www.yotron.de/s3app/).

| THREADS  | -t --threads | 1         | Threads for parallelization            | 4         |

With `s3app-run -h` you get the possible configuration: 

```
(s3app) vagrant@bullseye:~$ s3app-run -h
...
usage: s3app-run [-h] [-s HOST] [-p PORT] [-t THREADS]
