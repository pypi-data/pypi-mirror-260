# espeak-ng

A Python bindings library for the [eSpeak NG](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng?tab=readme-ov-file) utility, which is a compact open source software text-to-speech synthesizer with distributions for all major operating systems.

Platform support:

## Dependencies

This library provides Python bindings for the underlying `espeak-ng`
(or `espeak`), so obviously, you must have this library
installed. Follow instructions below for platform-specific
instructions.

**MacOS (using `brew`)**

```
$ brew tap justinokamoto/espeak-ng
$ brew install espeak-ng
```

**Debian (Ubuntu)**

```
# Install espeak library and headers, along with Python's C API headers
$ apt install libespeak-ng-dev python3-dev
```

## Installation

Provided you have installed the required dependencies described from
the previous section, you can download this Python package from the
Pythin Package Index:

```
$ pip install espeak-ng-python
```

## Usage

For all functions that this library wraps, it provides a near 1-to-1
wrapper interface, where all parameters are provided with identical
names. Only difference being that wrapper functions throw exceptions
rather than returning error codes (which is the more 'Pythonic' way of
error handling).

For more in-depth documentation you can read the comments within the
extension source code here:
[src/espeak\_ng/extension/\_espeakngmodule.c](https://github.com/justinokamoto/espeak-ng-python/blob/main/src/espeak_ng/extension/_espeakngmodule.c)

### Quick Start

#### Synchronous Mode

```python
import espeak_ng

# Initialize the espeak library
espeak_ng.initialize()

# This function will return after synthesis is complete
espeak_ng.synth("Hello, world.")
```

#### Asynchronous Mode

`espeak` offers a async interface. Below is an example snippet using
this interface:

```python
import espeak_ng

# NOTE: It's important to return 0 on success, otherwise synthesis will stop
def my_callback_func(wav: bytes, num_samples: int, event: espeak_ng.Event) -> int:
  # ... my code here
  return 0

# Initialize the espeak library in an asynchronous output mode
espeak_ng.initialize(output=espeak_AUDIO_OUTPUT.AUDIO_OUTPUT_PLAYBACK)

# This function will return immediately and the callback will be triggered as the synthesis
progresses
espeak_ng.set_synth_callback(my_callback_func)
```

#### Configuration

`espeak` supports various languages. To see all available options, you can list all voices:

```python
import espeak_ng

espeak_ng.list_voices()
```

To configure the voice, you can use the `set_voice_by_properties` function. Examples below:

```python
import espeak_ng

espeak_ng.set_voice_by_properties(name="en-us")
espeak_ng.set_voice_by_properties(gender=1)
espeak_ng.set_voice_by_properties(age=30)
```

## Building Locally

Install dependencies from the above "Dependencies" section. Then build this package using `pip`:

```
# Use pip to build in development (`-e` is for 'editable install')
$ pip install -e .
```

To run tests, use the helper `runtests` script:

```
$ python3 -m runtests
```

To build a local distribution archive, run:

```
$ pip wheel .
```
