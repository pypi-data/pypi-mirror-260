The output consists of three attributes: genre, whether the book has a sequel, and the sequel's name. The genre is a string with predefined options, the \"Has sequel\" attribute is a boolean, and the sequel's name is a string with a default value of None.\n\nHypothetical Examples:\n- Input: \n   {'book_title': 'Pride and Prejudice', 'book_author': 'Jane Austen', 'release_year': 1813}\n  Output: \n   Genre: 'fiction'\n   Has sequel: False\n   Sequel name: None\n\n- Input: \n   {'book_title': '1984', 'book_author': 'George Orwell', 'release_year': 1949}\n  Output: \n   Genre: 'sci-fi'\n   Has sequel: True\n   Sequel name: 'Animal Farm'\n\nOperation Suggestions: Based on the input-output relationship, it seems likely that the instruction involves mapping the book's attributes to the corresponding output attributes. The genre can be determined based on the book's genre, while the \"Has sequel\" attribute can be determined based on whether the book has a sequel or not. The \"Sequel name\" attribute can be filled based on the name of the sequel, if it exists.", "instruction": "Map the book's attributes to the corresponding output attributes.\n  - Determine the genre based on the book's genre.\n  - Determine if the book has a sequel and set the \"Has sequel\" attribute accordingly.\n  - If the book has a sequel, specify the name of the sequel in the \"Sequel name\" attribute."}}
