Your goal is to reverse engineer the instruction based on these models.\n\n1. Objective: Consider the objective of this task. What is the main purpose of transforming the input to the output as defined by these models?\n2. Input-Output Relationship: Analyze the relationship between the input and output. What patterns or rules might govern how the input is transformed into the output?\n3. Hypothetical Examples: Generate a few hypothetical examples of inputs and what the corresponding outputs would be. How do these examples adhere to the models?\n4. Operation Suggestions: Consider what types of operations (such as labeling, extracting, compressing, generating, etc.) could be used to transform any given input object with the mentioned structure into the desired output object. Which operation seems most fitting and why?\n\nBy methodically analyzing these aspects, you can deduce the most likely instruction that was originally used for this task.\"\nThis enhanced prompt encourages a more structured approach to reverse engineering the task instruction, prompting for a thorough analysis of the input and output models and their relationship.", "example_id": []}, "job_version": 0, "example_id": null, "example_version": null, "extra": null, "ref_event_id": null}
