# UXsim: Network traffic flow simulator in pure Python

[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/uxsim.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uxsim)

[(日本語の説明書はこちら/Japanese readme is here)](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/blob/main/README.jp.md)

*UXsim* is a free, open-source macroscopic and mesoscopic network traffic flow simulator developed in Python.
It is suitable for simulating large-scale (e.g., city-scale) vehicular transportation.
It computes dynamic traffic flow in a network by using traffic flow models commonly utilized by transportation research.
UXsim would be especially useful for scientific and educational purposes because of its simple, lightweight, and customizable features; but of course users are free to use UXsim for any purpose.

- [Technical documentation](https://toruseo.jp/UXsim/docs/index.html)
- [arXiv preprint on scientific overview](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17114)

## Main Features

- Dynamic network traffic simulation with a given network and time-dependent OD demand (i.e., dynamic traffic assignment). Specifically, the following models are used jointly:
	- Newell's simplified car-following model (X-Model)
	- Lagrangian Incremental Node Model
	- Dynamic User Optimum-type Route Choice Model (with inertia)
- Implementation of traffic management schemes (e.g., traffic signals, inflow control, route guidance, congestion pricing).
- Basic analysis of simulation results (e.g., trip completion rate, total travel time, delay), and their export to pandas.DataFrame and CSV files.
- Visualization of simulation results (e.g., time-space diagram, MFD, network traffic animation).
- Can be flexibly customized by users thanks to pure Python implementation.
	- Can also be directly integrated with other Python-based frameworks, such as PyTorch for deep reinforcement learning traffic control.

## Main Files

- `uxsim` directory: UXsim main package
	- `uxsim/uxsim.py`: UXsim main code
	- `uxsim/utils.py`: UXsim utilities code
 	- `uxsim/utils` directory:  UXsim utilities files
- `demos_and_examples` directory: Tutorials and examples of UXsim
- `dat` directory: Sample scenario files

## Usage

First, install UXsim package using pip:
```
pip install uxsim
```
or download the `uxsim` directory from this Github repo and place it to your local directory.
The former is required if you want to customize UXsim’s internal logic.

Then import the module using:
```python
from uxsim import *
```

The [Jupyter Notebook Demo](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/blob/main/demos_and_examples/demo_notebook_01en.ipynb) summarizes the basic usage and features.
For the further details, please see [demos_and_examples](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/tree/main/demos_and_examples) and [UXsim technical documentation](https://toruseo.jp/UXsim/docs/index.html).

## Simulation Examples

### Large-scale scenario

Belows are simulation result where approximately 60000 vehicles pass through a 10km x 10km grid network in 2 hours. The computation time was about 30 seconds on a standard desktop PC.

Visualization of link traffic states (thicker lines mean more vehicles, darker colors mean slower speeds) and some vehicle trajectories:

### Deep reinforcement learning signal control using PyTorch

Traffic signal controller is trained by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
The left is no control scenario with fixed signal timing; the traffic demand exceeds the network capacity with naive signal setting, and a gridlock occurs.
The right is with DRL control scenario, where traffic signal can be changed by observing queue length; although the demand level is the same, traffic is smoothly flowing.
[Jupyter Notebook of this example](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/blob/main/demos_and_examples/demo_notebook_03en_pytorch.ipynb) is available.

## Future Plans

- day-to-day dynamics
- taxi and shared mobility (i.e., vehicles travel through a network by passing through specific nodes that are dynamically updated)
- network import from OSMnx
- basemap for visualization
- modern packaging
