This repository is part of the [Platform for Oncogenomic Reporting and Interpretation (PORI)](https://bcgsc.github.io/pori/).

This python tool takes in variant inputs as tab-delimited files and annotates them using GraphKB.
The resulting output is uploaded to IPR as a report. Additional report content such as images and
metadata can be passed to be included in the report upload.

For documentation on how to create reports using this adaptor, see the [main documentation site](https://bcgsc.github.io/pori/) for the platform.
