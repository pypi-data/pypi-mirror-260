Q: Are you open for contributions?

A: Absolutely. You are highly encouraged to contribute implementations of steganographic methods. To ensure quality, we ask you for

- Contribute only concepts supported by peer-reviewed research.
- Make sure your code is sufficiently documented using docstring and comments.
- Cover your contribution with unit tests to ensure validity. Compare the outputs to an existing (reference) implementation.


Q: Can your library be used to embed and extract real messages?

A: No. In fact, it is non-trivial to turn conseal codebase into secure stego-system. We do not plan to do this, because publishing such tool is ethically questionable.
