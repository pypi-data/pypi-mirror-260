# This is the default config file, which is loaded with the Python configparser on module import.
# In addition to this default config file, the files ~/corpora/corpora.ini (where `~` is expanded
# to the user home directory) and corpora.ini in the current working directory are loaded (in that order)
# if they are present. Values specified in later files complement or overwrite values specified in earlier files.
# You can manually load more config files by using the load_config function. Specifying values in the [DEFAULT]
# section will overwrite the default values globally, also for sections/corpora specified in earlier files.
# This can for instance be used to change the default `root` directory in which the corpora are stored.

# Note that for any value you may provide long multi-line descriptions by indenting after linebreaks. These may
# contain arbitrary characters. The only special character is `$`, which is used to specify references to other
# sections and values as `${section:key}`. If you want to specify a literal `$` (e.g. for a regular expression) it has
# to be escaped: `$$`.

[DEFAULT]
# DEFAULT section: If a value is not specified in a particular corpus it will default to the value specified here.
# Not specifying a value is a valid option. The section [Name] should be a unique identifier to refer to that
# particular corpus when using load(corpus=Name) to load a corpus.

info
# [optional] A description of the corpus
# This info is available before actually accessing the corpus, so
# you should at least provide a short description with basic information.

root
# [optional] Root directory to store the corpus in.
# This should be an absolute path, `~` is expanded to the user home.
# If a relative path is specified, a warning is issued and it is interpreted relative to the current working directory.
# If `parent` is non-empty, this field is ignored and instead the parent's `path` is used.
# A call to get(Name, `root`) returns the effective value.
# If `path` specifies an absolute path, the `root` is ignored.

path
# [optional] Directory to store the corpus in.
# This can be an absolute path, in which case it replaces `root`.
# It can be a relative path, in which case it is appended to `root`.
# It can be empty, in which case the section/corpus [Name] is appended to `root`.
# Note that for sub-corpora (with non-empty `parent`) `root` corresponds to the parent's `path`.
# A call to get(Name, `path`) returns the effective value.

parent
# [optional] A parent corpus name.
# The parent corpus should be defined in a separate section.
# Initialisation (e.g. downloading from `url` with `access` method) is delegated to the parent corpus.

access
# [optional] How to access the corpus.
# Currently supported methods are: git, zip, tar.gz.

url
# [optional] URL to download the corpus from.

loader: FileCorpus
# [optional] The loader to be used.
# This value is used to look up loader functions in the loading.loaders dictionary.
# If you provide a custom loader function as keyword argument to the load function
# it will be called instead of performing a lookup.

# KEY: VALUE
# You can specify additional key-value pairs, which the load function
# hands over as keyword arguments with string value to the loader.
