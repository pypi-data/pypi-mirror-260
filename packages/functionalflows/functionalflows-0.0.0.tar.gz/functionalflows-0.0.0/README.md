# functionalflows
This repository contains basic tools for defining functional flows components, characteristics and metrics; 
and analyzing if those functional components are met in timeseries of daily flows.

This code is based on: 
    Yarnell, S. M., Stein, E. D., Webb, J. A., Grantham, T., Lusardi, R. A., Zimmerman, J., et al. (2020). 
    A functional flows approach to selecting ecologically relevant flow metrics for environmental flow applications.
