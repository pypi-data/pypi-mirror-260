"""This sub-package contains the entrypoints for the model auto-conversion services.
These entrypoints are used to convert models and run inference on them.
Currently, entrypoints are available for Keras only. However, more entrypoints
will be added in the future (e.g. PyTorch, sklearn, and TensorFlow).
