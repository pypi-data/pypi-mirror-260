## üêû Bugs and Issues

### Submitting Issues

We love to get issue reports. But we love it even more if they're in the right format. For any bugs you encounter, we need you to:

* **Describe your problem**: What exactly is the bug. Be as clear and concise as possible
* **Why do you think it's happening?** If you have any insight, here's where to share it

There are also a couple of nice to haves:

* **Environment:** You can find this with ``marie -vf``
* **Screenshots:** If they're relevant

# Coding standards

To ensure the readability of our code, we stick to a few conventions:

* We format python files using `black`.
* For linting, we use `flake81`.
* For sorting imports, we use `isort`.


The `setup.cfg` and `pyproject.toml` already contain the proper configuration for these tools. 
If you are working in a modern IDE (such a VSCode), which integrates these tools, the options will be picked up.
If you are working from the command line, you should use these tools form the root of this repository or via a `make` file.



We also provide a .pre-commit-config.yaml file, which enables you to use pre-commit to automatically perform the required linting/formatting actions before you commit your changes. 
You can install it using
```shell
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## ‚òëÔ∏è Naming Conventions

For branches, commits, and PRs we follow some basic naming conventions:

* Be descriptive
* Use all lower-case
* Limit punctuation
* Include one of our specified [types](#specify-the-correct-types)
* Short (under 70 characters is best)
* In general, follow the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) guidelines

Note: If you don't follow naming conventions, your commit will be automatically flagged to be fixed.

### Specify the correct types

Type is an important prefix in PR, commit message. For each branch, commit, or PR, we need you to specify the type to help us keep things organized. For example,

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: build, ci, chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- docs: Documentation only changes
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- chore: updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change
