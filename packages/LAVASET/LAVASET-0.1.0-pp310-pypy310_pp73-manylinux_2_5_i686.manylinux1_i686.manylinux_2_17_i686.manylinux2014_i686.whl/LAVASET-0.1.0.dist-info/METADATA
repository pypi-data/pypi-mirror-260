# LAVASET

LAVASET (Latent Variable Stochastic Ensemble of Trees) is a Python package designed for ensemble learning in datasets with complex spatial, spectral, and temporal dependencies. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide robust predictions, making it ideal for applications in remote sensing, time-series analysis, and beyond.

## Features

- **Efficient Handling of Correlated Data**: Optimized for datasets where traditional models struggle.
- **Cython-Powered Performance**: Critical computations are implemented in Cython for efficiency.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Tested and deployable across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Installation

You can install LAVASET directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install lavaset
```

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.7
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- Cython
- joblib

Cython and NumPy are incorporated as build dependencies for LAVASET and are pre-installed before the package setup. If you encounter any issues during installation, especially regarding Cython or NumPy, consider installing these packages manually before proceeding with the LAVASET installation.
