### ✒️ Nanopub signing process

- Preliminary nanopub is created with blank space in URIs at the places where the trusty URI code will appear (normalized URI: `https://w3id.org/np/ `, cf. [code](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-java/blob/22bba0e79508309f1c6163970f49ab596beadeb0/src/main/java/org/nanopub/trusty/TempUriReplacer.java#L12)); this includes the signature part, except the triple that is stating the actual signature
- Preliminary nanopub is serialized in a normalized fashion (basically each quad on four lines with minimal escaping)
- Signature is calculated on this normalized representation (cf. most of the process in the [trusty-uri python lib](https://github.dev/trustyuri/trustyuri-python/blob/9f29732c4abae9d630d36e6da24720e02f543ebf/trustyuri/rdf/RdfHasher.py#L15), see also [SignatureUtils](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-java/blob/22bba0e79508309f1c6163970f49ab596beadeb0/src/main/java/org/nanopub/extra/security/SignatureUtils.java#L196) and [trusty-uri](https://github.com/trustyuri/trustyuri-java/blob/08b61fbb13d20a5cbefde617bd9a9e9b0b03d780/src/main/java/net/trustyuri/rdf/RdfHasher.java#L86))
- Signature triple is added
- Trusty URI code is calculated on normalized representation that includes signature
- Trusty URI code is added in place of all the occurrences of blank spaces in the URIs, leading to the final trusty nanopub

### ☑️ To do

- [ ] Add possibility to build the nanopub from scratch for JS and python
- [ ] Integrate to the python `nanopub` library to perform signing?
- [ ] Add Ruby bindings? https://docs.rs/magnus/latest/magnus https://github.com/ankane/tokenizers-ruby
- [ ] Add Java bindings? https://docs.rs/jni/latest/jni
- [ ] Add brew packaging? (cf. [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/pkg/brew/ripgrep-bin.rb))

## 🧑‍💻 Development workflow

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), python, and NodeJS are required for development.

Install development dependencies:

```bash
# Create and activate python virtual env
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install python dependencies
pip install maturin pre-commit

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Install rust dev tools
rustup update
rustup component add rustfmt clippy
cargo install wasm-pack cargo-tarpaulin cargo-deny cargo-make
```

### 📥️ Clone the repository

Clone the `nanopub-rs` repository, `cd` into it, and create a new branch for your contribution:

```bash
cd nanopub-rs
git checkout -b add-my-contribution
```

###  🧪 Test Rust crate

Run tests for the rust crate:

```bash
cargo test
```

!!! example "More options"

    Display prints:

    ```bash
    cargo test -- --nocapture
    ```

    Run a specific test:

    ```bash
    cargo test sign_nanopub_blank -- --nocapture
    ```

    If tests panic without telling on which test it failed:

    ```bash
    cargo test -- --test-threads=1
    ```




Test the `nanopub` crate with code coverage:

```bash
cargo tarpaulin -p nanopub --out html
```

### 🐍 Test Python package

Build the pip package and run `pytest` tests:

```bash
./scripts/test-python.sh
```

Or just run the tests:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
cd python
pytest
```

### 🟨 Test JavaScript package

Build the npm package and run `jest` tests:

```bash
./scripts/test-js.sh
```

Start a web server to access the dev webpage:

```bash
python -m http.server 3000 --directory ./js
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

### ⌨️ Test CLI

Test signing a nanopublication with the commandline interface:

```bash
cd cli
cargo run -- sign ../lib/tests/resources/nanopub_test_blank.trig
```

### 🌈 Run all tests

```bash
./scripts/test-all.sh
```

### ✨ Format

```bash
cargo fmt
```

### 🧹 Lint

```bash
cargo clippy --all --all-targets --all-features
```

### 📖 Generate docs

```bash
./scripts/docs.sh
```

### 🎭️ Work on the demo webpage

Start a web server at [localhost:3000/playground.html](http://localhost:3000/playground.html)

```bash
python -m http.server 3000 --directory ./lib/docs
```

### 📦️ Build and run

All packages at once:

```bash
cargo build --all
cargo run --all-features
```

### ️⛓️ Check supply chain

Check the dependency supply chain: licenses (only accept dependencies with OSI or FSF approved licenses), and vulnerabilities (CVE advisories).

```bash
cargo deny check
```

### 🏷️ New release

Publishing artifacts will be done by the `build.yml` workflow, make sure you have set the following tokens as secrets for this repository: `PYPI_TOKEN`, `NPM_TOKEN`, `CRATES_IO_TOKEN`, `CODECOV_TOKEN`

Install dependency:

```bash
cargo install cargo-release cargo-outdated
```

1. Make sure dependencies have been updated:

   ```bash
   cargo update
   cargo outdated
   ```

2. Run the release script, it will bump the version in the `Cargo.toml` files, generate the changelog, commit, create a new tag, and push to GitHub

   ```bash
   ./scripts/release.sh 0.0.2
   ```

4. The `build.yml` workflow will automatically build artifacts (binary, pip wheel, npm package), create a new release on GitHub, and add the artifacts to the new release.
