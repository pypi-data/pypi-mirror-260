Simple Text Summarization Tool Overview This Simple Text Summarization Tool is an open-source Python application designed to automatically summarize text, making it easier to digest large amounts of information quickly. Utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), this tool identifies the key sentences in a text that are most representative of its overall content.

Features Sentence Tokenization: Breaks down the text into sentences using NLTK's sent_tokenize. Word Tokenization: Splits sentences into individual words to analyze their frequency, ignoring stopwords. Frequency Analysis: Identifies the most significant words in the text based on their occurrence. Summarization: Selects sentences that contain the most frequent significant words, providing a concise summary of the text. Installation Before running the summarization tool, ensure you have Python and NLTK installed. Then, install the necessary NLTK packages using the following commands:

bash Copy code import nltk nltk.download('punkt') nltk.download('stopwords') Usage To use the summarization tool, simply run the script from your command line, passing the text you want to summarize as an argument:

bash Copy code python summarize_text.py "Your text to summarize goes here..." Contributing Contributions to the Simple Text Summarization Tool are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or bug fixes, please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
