# darklink

A tool to quickly transfer a file to or from a compromised system during security assessments.

## Features

Unlike `python3 -m http.server` darklink will:

- Generate the command for you to copy and paste on the compromised host.
- Expose only the specific file you want to transfer, rather than the entire working directory.
- Automatically fetch and transfer the latest versions of commonly used tools (e.g., winPEAS, linPEAS, mimikatz).
- Allow you to exfiltrate files from the compromised host to your machine.
