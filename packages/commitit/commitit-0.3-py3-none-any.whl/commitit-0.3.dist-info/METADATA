# GitCommitAutomation

This package provides a simple automation tool for generating Git commits in the past. It's designed to help in scenarios where you want to backfill your Git history for a project. The script modifies a file named `data.txt`, adds a new line with a date indicating when the commit should have been made, and then commits this change to the repository with the commit date set to the specified number of days ago.

## Installation

Before installing and using GitCommitAutomation, ensure you have Git installed on your system. You can then download this package, unzip it, and navigate into the package directory. Alternatively
in your terminal do
`pip install commitit`

## Usage

To use the GitCommitAutomation script, follow these steps:

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Clone a github repo.
4. In your repo do `pip install commitit`
5. Then run the function called `make_commit()`

```bash
from commitit import make_commit
make_commit()
```
