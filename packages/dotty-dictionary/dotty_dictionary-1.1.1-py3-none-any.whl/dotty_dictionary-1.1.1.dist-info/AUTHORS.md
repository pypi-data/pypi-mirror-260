# Credits

As mentioned at [README.md](README.md), this project is a fork of 
[pawelzny/dotty_dict](https://github.com/pawelzny/dotty_dict) and the original author is Pawel Zadrozny.

It appears that the original project is no longer maintained, so I decided to fork it and maintain it myself.

If you are original author (i.e. Pawel Zadrozny) and you want to take over this project, please let me know.
