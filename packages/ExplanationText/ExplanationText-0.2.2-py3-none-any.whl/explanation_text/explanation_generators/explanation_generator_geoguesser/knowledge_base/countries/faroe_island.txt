The landscape of the Faroe islands is characterised by long, wide fjords with jagged green mountains that rise straight out of the water, with rocky ridge lines along the mountainsides. The mountains generally look more imposing and greener than coastal mountains in Iceland, which can often be used to tell them apart.

The Faroe islands have almost no naturally growing trees.

All car coverage on the Faroe Islands has a black Street View car with a plain grey roof rack.

No other country with a similar landscape has a car similar to this.

Faroese houses are typically made of wood, often with an above ground basement made of stone which is painted in a different colour than the wooden part. Roofs will usually be either metal or have grass on top (turf).

The Faroese language is most closely related to Icelandic, with the special letters Á, Ð, Í, Ó, Ú, Ý, Æ and Ø. It differs from Icelandic by using the letter Ø, while Icelandic uses É and Þ.

Faroese bollards are small wooden sticks painted red on the top and yellow on the bottom.

Directional signs are yellow with a thin white border, identical to the ones on Iceland.
