Mongolia is a rather barren country with little vegetation. Some of the roads in Malaysia are unpaved and mostly just dirt, other regions often have no paths at all. The capital, Ulaanbaatar is fairly recognisable and features many apartment buildings that are crammed together. Ulaanbaatar has mountains just south of the city. Mongolia uses fairly narrow, white license plates that contrast the Kyrgyzstan elongated plates with the red stripe. Additionally, Mongolia doesn’t look as cold as Kyrgyzstan. Mongolia uses its own Cyrillic letter- Ң. The landscape across most of the country is rather barren and there is little vegetation. The south-eastern part of Mongolia is desert. This part of Mongolia is especially dry and featureless (even by Mongolian standards). Mongolia has many small villages and towns. These areas are often contained by wooden fences. The houses tend to have bright roofs of different colours. Other Mongolian residents live in round tents known as yurts. The surrounding landscape in Mongolia is often grass. Mongolian bollards sometimes lack stripes and are just white. Mongolian license plates are all white and fairly narrow. They are much less elongated than plates from Kyrgyzstan and also lack the red Kyrgyzstan stripe. Mongolian uses Cyrillic. Үү and Өө are unique to Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.
