Mali is generally an arid country. Seeing a sandy, dry landscape can help with immediately distinguishing the Mali tripods from most tripods in other countries. In Mali, there are some historical mosques. These mosques have a recognizable look: they are made out of mud bricks and adobe plaster. The walls of the buildings are decorated with wooden sticks. Inside, you will usually see the same adobe walls, and prayer rugs on the floor.
Outside of the mosques are regular streets.
