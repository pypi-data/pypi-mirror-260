Curaçao is a constituent country in the Kingdom of the Netherlands located north of western Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea.

Curaçao uses square licence plates that appear completely white through when blurred.

While front plates are mandatory, a minority will still not have front plates.

Vegetation:
Due to Curaçao’s semi-arid climate, cacti can commonly be seen.

Much of the architecture on Curaçao consists of simple, one storey bungalows that are pastel coloured. Metal roofs are common on smaller shacks, while tiled roofs can be seen on more expensive houses. Additionally, multi storey villas can sometimes be seen.

White and black striped traffic light posts can be seen in urban areas.

Wooden poles with three horizontal, alternating insulators are common.
