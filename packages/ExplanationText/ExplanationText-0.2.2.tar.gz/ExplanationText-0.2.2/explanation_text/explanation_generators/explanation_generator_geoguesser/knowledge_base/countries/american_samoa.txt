American Samoa is situated just east of the International Date Line and Fiji. One of the easiest ways to find it is to locate the northern point of Australia and to scan directly east. To the east of the main American Samoan island of Tutuila lie three smaller islands. The island doublet that is pictured to the west is Ofu-Olosega. To the east is Ta’u. American Samoa is very hilly, very tropical and has white sand. Parts of American Samoa feature very steep mountains that are rather conspicuous from most of the island. In American Samoa, you will commonly just see the back of a black ute if you pan down. On the island doublet of Ofu-Olosega coverage is mainly focused along the beach. American Samoa has blue license plates. Cars drive on the right in American Samoa (which is rare for an island) and there is often a double yellow line in the centre of the road. The most populated island in American Samoa is Tutuila. This island features coverage along lots of roads and the island is more inhabited. The island doublet of Ofu-Olosega and the island of Ta’u feature very minimal coverage and the islands are less developed. 

American Samoa is a group of islands east of Fiji, located in the Pacific Ocean. Since it is a US overseas territory, for country streak purposes, it is counted as the US.

The general landscape consists of green, tropical mountains with many palm trees. Small roads are often made of concrete. Most houses are one storey, and have a simple box design. Plain metal sheet roofs are also very common.
