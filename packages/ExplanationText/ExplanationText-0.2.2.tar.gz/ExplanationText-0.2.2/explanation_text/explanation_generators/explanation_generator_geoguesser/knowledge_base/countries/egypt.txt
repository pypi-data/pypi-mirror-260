There are seven sections of coverage, each centred around historic places of interest, ranging from the Pyramids to Coptic churches and medieval citadels.

The official language in Egypt is Arabic. You can occasionally see it on signs in several of the trekkers. Its script can be identified by its lines and dots.

Most Helpful:

Egypt is really easy to figure out. Nearly all of the maps will have the Pyramids somewhere in the background. A lot of World maps dont use Trekker coverage, so its mostly Battle Royale or Official maps that will contain the coverage.

This is the general feel of the Mosque of Mohammad Ali. Its located South East of the word Cairo on the map. You can also generally see this mosque from every spot of the official coverage.

This street all this coverage on is called “Mari Gerges” and covers a bunch of Churches. It is due east of the word Giza on the map. Its also the only place you will end up on a road that has churches.

A lot of the coverage is on the Giza Plateau. Its kind of obvious that you’re near the pyramids as they’re very prominent.

There is, however, a chance to end up in Alexandria. The official coverage in Alexandria only exists at the Citadel of Qaitbay along the north western coast.

Its clearly different from the other coverage. Its also the only coverage near a large body of water.

License plates:

License plates are super rare due to the limited coverage. However, these are the private vehicle plates. They can be found on the one road that has coverage over to the East of Giza on the Coverage picture above.
