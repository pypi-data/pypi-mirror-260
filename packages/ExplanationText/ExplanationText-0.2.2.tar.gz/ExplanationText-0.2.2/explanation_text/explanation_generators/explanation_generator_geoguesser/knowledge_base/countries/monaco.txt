Monaco is a European microstate on the French Riviera, a few kilometres west of the border with Italy.

Monaco is a rich and densely populated city state, with a Mediterranean feel to it. The architecture is similar to cities in southern France and northern Italy, but more luxurious. You will see a lot of apartment buildings, neoclassical details, and pastel colours. There are essentially no rural areas.

Monaco’s licence plates are short and lack the blue strip.

You will still see a lot of French cars around, that often have yellow back plates.

Monaco is a hilly country. The very few areas that are not built up show mediterranean vegetation.

Planted palm trees are common.

Monaco has some tunnels.

Rows of parked mopeds are a common sight around Monaco’s streets.

You can often see Monaco’s skyline and the hills beyond it. There are a lot of expensive yachts around.
