Guatemala is very hilly and even the urban areas are often undulating. It is rare to find a flat section. Urban areas in Guatemala typically have a grid pattern. The landscape is largely a lush, dense and green jungle with a tropical feel. Like Mexico, there are often plentiful electrical wires overhead. Some urban parts of Guatemala have cobbled streets. Like Mexico, the word “ALTO” appears on Guatemalan stop signs. This contrasts the word “PARE” appearing on South American stop signs. Guatemalan utility poles are sometimes painted towards the bottom of the pole. Some Guatemalan utility poles are completely green. There are signs all across Guatemala that indicate how far away Guatemala City is. If you see a high number (typically over 300km), you will be in the north of the country and if you see a lower number (less than 200km), you should be in the southern part of Guatemala.

Guatemala has short licence plates, which when blurred will typically have either a blue tinge, or a hint of green on the left side.

Like Mexico, Guatemala uses the word “ALTO” on stop signs.
