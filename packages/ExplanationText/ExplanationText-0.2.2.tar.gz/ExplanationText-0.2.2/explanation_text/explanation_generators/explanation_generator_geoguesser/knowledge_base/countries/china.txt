Road Lines:

There are some chances for you to see a road, although you wont be on any of them. China does use a yellow divider and white shoulder lines.

Road Signs:

China uses red and white signs, however its very limited with their current coverage.

China also uses blue signs that point you towards destinations. You wont find too many of these on street view.

License plates:

China uses these blue license plates. The first character you see is actually the province the plate is listed in. In the example above, it is for the region of Shandong and Guangdong. However, most plates you can come across will be blurred, but there are a few examples of unblurred plates in China.

Architecture:

China has these roofs that are also common in Japan. This architecture is quite prominent.

General look:

This is the most common town you can find in China. That is because it is one of the few places that has outdoor coverage. It can be found in most user created world maps. Its in the South East of China and can be seen as the red pin on the picture below.
