Midway Atoll is located in the North Pacific Ocean, north-west from Hawaii. Midway Atoll is one of nine insular areas of the USA known collectively as the United States Outlying Islands. Midway Atoll is often instantly recognisable thanks to the thousands of albatross chicks that swarm the entire area. The only part of Midway Atoll that isnâ€™t swarming with albatross is the airport runway.
