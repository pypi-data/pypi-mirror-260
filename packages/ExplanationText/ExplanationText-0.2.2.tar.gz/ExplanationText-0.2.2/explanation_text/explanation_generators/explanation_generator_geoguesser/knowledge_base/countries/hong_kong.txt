Outside the urban areas, Hong Kong is generally quite mountainous, with green, subtropical vegetation. There is extensive coverage in rural areas outside the city, with many roads going through the mountains. You might see low-rise rural buildings, however usually you will not need to travel far to see tall apartment blocks.

Singapore, on the other hand, is very flat.

One very striking aspect of Hong Kong architecture are the many extremely tall apartment buildings found throughout the city. 

Apartment buildings in Singapore and Taiwan tend to be not nearly as tall as those in Hong Kong.

Because of the subtropical climate, air conditioners attached to the walls of apartments are very common in Hong Kong.
