The Isle of Man is located in the Irish Sea, midway between Ireland and Great Britain. As the Isle of Man is a British Crown dependency, it has inherited many of the same features as the UK. The Isle of Man uses white front license plates and yellow rear license plates- like the UK. The Isle of Man is unique however as they use a red stripe of the left of their plate, not the blue stripe of most of Europe. The Isle of Man looks similar to large parts of the UK. It does however tend to be more rural and have even narrower roads than the UK. The Isle of Man has a distinct red, vertical stripe on the left of their license plates. The front Isle of Man plates are white. Like the UK, the Isle of Man has yellow rear plates. Unlike the UK, the plates have a red stripe on the left. The Isle of Man has very narrow, windy roads and often bushes alongside the roads. The majority of the Isle of Man is sparsely populated with the occasional houses popping up in the largely rural areas. Cars drive on the left in the Isle of Man, their language is English and in most respects, the Isle of the Man has identical features to the UK. Like the UK, the Isle of Man uses these black, white and red bollards. The rear of the bollard has a white rectangle instead of the red rectangle. These green directional signs provide useful road number and town direction information when navigating in the Isle of Man. Major roads are ‘A’ roads (despite being major for the Isle of Man, they are often small and narrow) whilst minor roads are ‘B’ roads.
