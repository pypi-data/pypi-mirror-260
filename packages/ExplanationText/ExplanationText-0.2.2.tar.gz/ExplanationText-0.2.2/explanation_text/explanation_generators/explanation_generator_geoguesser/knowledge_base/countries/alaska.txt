The most common and recognisable Alaskan licence plate is all yellow. You can also get a plate with a large orange circle in the middle. Front plates are required in Alaska.

Trees in Alaska are generally thinner and have less broad leaves than those seen in the other 49 states.
On a lot of the Alaskan coverage you will be able to see tall, snow covered mountains.
