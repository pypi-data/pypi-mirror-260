### Basic Logger Setup

```python

```

### Change Log File

```python
from hlogger import create_logger, logger

# Create a logger
create_logger("app_logger", "app_log.log")

# Log messages
logger.info("Application started")

# Change the log file dynamically
create_logger("app_logger", "new_app_log.log")

# Log messages with the new log file
logger.warning("Application warning")
```

### Set Logger

from hlogger import create_logger, set_logger, logger

# Create a logger
create_logger("app_logger", "app_log.log")
