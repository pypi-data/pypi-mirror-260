REVERSE IRON BUTTERFLY
A reverse iron butterfly is a multi-leg, risk-defined, neutral options strategy 
with limited profit potential. It is designed to take advantage of a rise in 
volatility and large price movement from the underlying asset 1. It involves 
buying a bull call debit spread and a bear put debit spread with the long options 
centered at the same strike price.

The best time to enter into a reverse iron butterfly is when you expect the 
underlying asset to make a large move in either direction before expiration 
and when implied volatility is expected to increase 1. This strategy profits 
the most when the underlying asset makes a large move and/or when implied 
volatility increases.
