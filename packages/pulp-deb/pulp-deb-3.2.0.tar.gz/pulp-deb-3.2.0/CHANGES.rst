3.2.0 (2024-03-04)
==================

Features
--------

- Added feature to serve published artifacts from previous publications for 3 days.
  This fulfills the apt-by-hash/acquire-by-hash spec by allowing by-hash files to be cached for a
  period of 3 days.

- Added retrieve functionality for ReleaseArchitecture and ReleaseComponent content.
  `#1010 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/1010>`_

  `#1027 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/1027>`_


Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed repo uniqueness constraints.
  Duplicate packages with identical checksums are now allowed.
  In addition, duplicates are now also handled for the set of incoming content.

Removals

3.0.0 (2023-09-05)
==================

Features
--------

- Added ``version``, ``origin``, ``label``, and ``description`` fields to Releases.
  These fields can be set when creating new Releases via the API.
  Going forward, they will also be synced from upstream release files if present.
  `#449 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/449>`_
- Specify and remember the Signing Services we want to use for each Repo / Release.
  `#641 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/641>`_

  `#646 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/646>`_
- Added the ``publish_upstream_release_fields`` field to the repository model.
  To avoid a breaking change in publication behaviour, existing repositories are populated with the setting set to ``False``, while any newly created repostiroies will default to ``True``.
  Whatever the value on the repository, it can be overriden when creating a new publication.
  `#793 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/793>`_


Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed KeyError during publish if package has architecture that's not supported in the Packages file.
  Instead, a warning message will be logged.
  `#777 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/777>`_
- Fixed an async error preventing synchronization with ``sync_installer`` set to ``True``.
  `#797 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/797>`_
- Fixed content creating code triggered in rare edge cases when unapplying DB migration 0021.
  `#806 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/806>`_
- Fixed a bug where structured package upload was only working as intended for the first package uploaded to each repository.
  Also added logging and ensured structure content is added to the creating tasks ``created_resources`` list.
  `#807 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/807>`_


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Added ``pulp-cli-deb`` installation instructions.
  `#598 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/598>`_
- Replaced references to the Pulp Ansible installer with references to the Pulp OCI images.

  `#867 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/867>`_
- Completely reworked the "Feature Overview" and "Workflows" docs with an emphasise on Pulp CLI and structured content.
  `#886 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/886>`_


Removals
--------

- Since release file fields including "Label" and "Version", are now synced from upstream repositories, we have dropped the PUBLISH_RELEASE_FILE_LABEL and PUBLISH_RELEASE_FILE_VERSION settings.
  This removes the ability to publish Pulp internal "Label" and "Version" values that never made much sense, and had been disabled by default since at least pulp_deb 2.18.0.
  `#449 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/449>`_
- The codename and suite fields are removed from the ReleaseComponent and ReleaseArchitecture models and all associated filters and viewsets.
  `#599 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/599>`_
- The ``pulp/api/v3/publications/deb/apt/`` API endpoint, used to require users to explicitly set at least one of ``simple`` or ``structured`` to ``True`` on the POST.
  The new behavior is to default to ``structured=True`` and ``simple=False``.
  `#858 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/858>`_


Misc
----

- This change includes a large DB migration to drop 'codename' and 'suite' from the uniqueness constraints of all structure content.
  The migration will merge any resulting collisions and alter all records with a foreign key relation to the so eliminated content to point at the merge result instead.
  `#599 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/599>`_
- Added test cases for advanced copy task.
  `#758 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/758>`_
- Add tests for content filters, and make filters return empty list if Content not in RepoVersion instead of raising ValidationError.
  `#780 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/780>`_
- Added better scoping for the pytest fixtures.
  `#790 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/790>`_

  As a result, the available filters where also adjusted for the new fields.
