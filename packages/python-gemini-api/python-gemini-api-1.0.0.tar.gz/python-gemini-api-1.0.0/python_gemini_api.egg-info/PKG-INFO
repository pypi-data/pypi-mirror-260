# <img src="https://www.gstatic.com/lamda/images/favicon_v1_150160cddff7f294ce30.svg" width="35px" alt="Gemini Icon" /> Google - Gemini API
A Python wrapper, [python-gemini-api](https://pypi.org/project/python-gemini-api/), interacts with [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) via reverse engineering. Reconstructing with REST syntax for users facing frequent authentication errors or unable to authenticate properly in [Google Authentication](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2?hl=ko).

Collaborated competently with [Antonio Cheong](https://github.com/acheong08).


## What is [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction)?
Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini Pro and Gemini Pro Vision models. In February 2024, Google's **Bard** service was changed to **Gemini**. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805), [Official Website](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction), [Official API](https://aistudio.google.com/), [API Documents](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/gemini).

## Installation
```bash
pip install python-gemini-api
```
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Gemini-API.git
```

## Authentication
> [!NOTE]
> Cookies can change quickly. Don't reopen the same session or repeat prompts too often; they'll expire faster. If the cookie value doesn't export correctly, refresh the Gemini page and export again. Check this [sample cookie file](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Gemini-API/blob/main/cookies.txt).
1. Visit https://gemini.google.com/ and wait for it to fully load.
2. *(Recommended)* Export cookies on the gemini site using a Chrome extension. Use [ExportThisCookies](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/exportthiscookie/dannllckdimllhkiplchkcaoheibealk), then open and copy the txt file contents. For manual collection, see [this image](assets/cookies.pdf).
3. *(Additional requirement)* To manually collect the nonce value: Press F12 → Network → Send any prompt to webui gemini → Click the post address starting with "https://gemini.google.com/_/BardChatUi/data/assistant.lamda.BardFrontendService/StreamGenerate" → Payload → Form Data → Copy the "at" key value. Reference [this image](assets/nonce_value.pdf).

## Usage
After changed Bard to Gemini, multiple cookies, *often updated*, are needed based on region or Google account. Thus, automatic cookie renewal logic is crucial.
### Initialization
You must appropriately set the `cookies_dict` parameter to `Gemini` class. When using the `auto_cookies` argument to automatically collect cookies, keep the [Gemini web page](https://gemini.google.com/) opened that receives Gemini's response open in your web browser.<br>

```python
from gemini import Gemini

cookies = {
    "key": "value"
}

GeminiClient = Gemini(cookies=cookies)
# GeminiClient = Gemini(cookie_fp="folder/cookie_file.json") # Or use cookie file path
# GeminiClient = Gemini(auto_cookies=True) # Or use auto_cookies paprameter
# GeminiClient = Gemini(cookies=cookies, nonce="value") # If you encounter nonce error, pass nonce value. See `Authentication` section above.
```
Can update cookies automatically using [broser_cookie3](https://github.com/borisbabic/browser_cookie3). For the first attempt, manually download the cookies to test the functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *Before proceeding, ensure that the GeminiClient object is defined without any errors.*
<br>

### Text generation
```python
prompt = "Hello, Gemini. What's the weather like in Seoul today?"
response = GeminiClient.generate_content(prompt)
print(response)
```

### Image generation

```
prompt = "Hello, Gemini. Give me a beautiful photo of Seoul's scenery."
response = GeminiClient.generate_content(prompt)

print("\n".join(response.images)) # Print images

for i, image in enumerate(response.images): # Save images
    image.save(path="folder_path/", filename=f"seoul_{i}.png")

```

### Generate content with image

As an experimental feature, it is possible to ask questions with an image. However, this functionality is only available for accounts with image upload capability in Gemini's web UI. 

```
prompt = "What is in the image?"
image = open("folder_path/image.jpg", "rb").read() # (jpeg, png, webp) are supported.

response = GeminiClient.generate_content(prompt, image)
```

### [Text To Speech(TTS)](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech?hl=ko) from Gemini
Business users and high traffic volume may be subject to account restrictions according to Google's policies. Please use the [Official Google Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) for any other purpose. 
```
text = "Hello, I'm developer in seoul" # Gemini will speak this sentence
response = GeminiClient.generate_content(prompt)
audio = GeminiClient.speech(text)
with open("speech.ogg", "wb") as f:
    f.write(bytes(audio["audio"]))
```

<br>

## Further
### Behind a proxy
If you are working behind a proxy, use the following.
```python
proxies = {
    "http": "http://proxy.example.com:8080",
    "https": "https://proxy.example.com:8080"
}

GeminiClient = Gemini(cookies=cookies, proxies=proxies, timeout=30)
GeminiClient.generate_content("Hello, Gemini. Give me a beautiful photo of Seoul's scenery.")
```

### Use rotating proxies

If you want to **avoid blocked requests** and bans, then use [Smart Proxy by Crawlbase](https://crawlbase.com/docs/smart-proxy/?utm_source=github_ad&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=bard_api). It forwards your connection requests to a **randomly rotating IP address** in a pool of proxies before reaching the target website. The combination of AI and ML make it more effective to avoid CAPTCHAs and blocks.

```python
# Get your proxy url at crawlbase https://crawlbase.com/docs/smart-proxy/get/
proxy_url = "http://xxxxx:@smartproxy.crawlbase.com:8012" 
proxies = {"http": proxy_url, "https": proxy_url}

GeminiClient = Gemini(cookies=cookies, proxies=proxies, timeout=30)
GeminiClient.generate_content("Hello, Gemini. Give me a beautiful photo of Seoul's scenery.")
```


### Reusable session object
You can continue the conversation using a reusable session. However, this feature is limited, and it is difficult for a package-level feature to perfectly maintain context. You can try to maintain the consistency of conversations same way as other LLM services, such as passing some sort of summary of past conversations to the DB.
```python
from gemini import Gemini, HEADERS
import requests

cookies = {
    "key": "value"
}

session = requests.Session()
session.headers = HEADERS
session.cookies.update(cookies)

GeminiClient = Gemini(session=session, timeout=30)
response = GeminiClient.generate_content("Hello, Gemini. What's the weather like in Seoul today?")

# Continued conversation without set new session
response = GeminiClient.generate_content("What was my last prompt?")
```

## How to use open-source [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b)
[Gemma](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b) models are Google's lightweight, advanced text-to-text, decoder-only language models, derived from Gemini research. Available in English, they offer open weights and variants, ideal for tasks like question answering and summarization. Their small size enables deployment in resource-limited settings, broadening access to cutting-edge AI. For more infomation, visit [Gemma-7b](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b) model card.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/gemma-7b")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("google/gemma-7b")

input_text = "Write me a poem about Machine Learning."
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

outputs = model.generate(**input_ids)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```
