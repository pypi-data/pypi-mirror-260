Pytest to TestRail Plugin
=========================

Create and update testplans and/or testruns in TestRail based on pytest results. Test functions marked with a TestRail case ID will have their results sent to TestRail.


This project preserves the functionality of the deprecated `pytest-testrail <https://github.com/allankp/pytest-testrail/>`_ project, incorporating all of its features, while introducing additional modifications for the proper handling of tests marked with the xfail marker.

Features
--------

- Transfers Pytest results to TestRail.
- Easy integration with your existing Pytest suite.
- Proper handling of tests marked with xfail (pytest.mark.xfail):

  - Sends test as FAILED to the TestRail if test fail as expected.
  - Sends test as PASSED to the TestRail if test unexpectedly pass.
  - Sends test as FAILED to the TestRail if test has argument ``run=false``

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

   import pytest

   @pytest.mark.case_id('C1950')
   def test_all_the_things():
       doit = True
       assert doit

Installation
------------

Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

Via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pytest-testrail-results

Plugin Configuration
--------------------

The following values are required:

- A valid TestRail instance URL.
- A valid email address for a user on the instance.
- A valid API key for the user.

They can be set on the command line via the follow flags:

.. code-block:: bash

  --tr-url=<your_url>
  --tr-email=<your_email>
  --tr-password=<your_password>

Alternatively, they can be set via a pytest configuration file:

.. code-block:: ini

  [pytest]
    tr_url=<your_url>
    tr_email=<your_email>
    tr_password=<your_password>

Marking Tests
-------------

case_id
~~~~~~~

The ``case_id`` marker takes a string which must match an existing TestRail testcase.
Only tests with this marker will be added to the TestRail testrun.

.. code:: python

  import pytest

  # This test's results will be uploaded.
  @pytest.mark.case_id('C1950')
  def test_all_the_things():
    ...

  # This test's results will not be uploaded.
  def test_all_the_other_things():
    ...

defect_ids
~~~~~~~~~~

The 'defect_ids' marker takes a list of strings. These will be used in the ``defect``
field in TestRail. This is useful for tests with known failures.

Typically, these are IDs for your bug tracking software.

.. code:: python

  import pytest

  @pytest.mark.case_id('C1950')
  @pytest.mark.defect_ids(['JS-7001', 'JS-9001'])
  def test_all_the_things():
    ...

Running Pytest
--------------

The ``--testrail`` command-line flag must be present to upload results:

.. code-block:: bash

  pytest --testrail
